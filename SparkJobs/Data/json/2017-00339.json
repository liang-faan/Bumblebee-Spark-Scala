The combination of natural red and blue dyes on a cream ground is also characteristic of batiks made during this period in the north coast of Java\n before the invention and widespread popularity of chemical dyes in batik sarongs by the late 19th century.  Oey Soen King’s pieces were all unsigned as signatures were not yet fashionable.\n",
