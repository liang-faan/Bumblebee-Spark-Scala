It consists of a turquoise A-line skirt that was coordinated with a short-sleeve collared blouse with a narrow bow in batik print design.  The uniform was designed by French couturier Pierre Balmain, and was first unveiled in 1968 when Singapore Airlines was still part of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA).  Balmain’s choice of batik print for the uniforms of both cabin crew and ground staff was a means for SIA to assert Malayan identity and hospitality. The batik print design consists of brightly-coloured floral motifs and a colourful border resembling the sawtooth motif that runs along the edges of these uniforms.
