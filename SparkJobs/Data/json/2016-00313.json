This object shows the taste for luxury objects in Northern India in the 19th century. In Mughal India there was a great revival in the art of rock crystal carving, and Mughal craftsmen reached new heights of technical virtuosity especially during the reign of Shah Jahan (1628-1658). The motifs in the gem work and enamelling of flowers, plants, scrolling vines and animal forms allude to paradise gardens on earth. It would have been highly prized and made for a privileged few.",
