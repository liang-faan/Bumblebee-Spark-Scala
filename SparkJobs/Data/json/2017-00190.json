Chanâ€™s collection forms part of a larger collection of materials gathered by Tan Chong Tee (1916- 2012), who was also a key member of this resistance group. The collection consists of original materials belonging to Tan and other members of Force 136 dating from the 1940s to new materials reproduced from memory by Tan Chong Tee, which date from the late 1980s to early 2000s. \r\n\r\nForce 136 was set up in July 1942 as part of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). It recruited and trained local guerillas to gather intelligence and create an underground spy network to support planned British invasion of Japanese-occupied Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe notes contain information on the nature of explosives and how to proceed with a guerrilla mission. \r\n",
