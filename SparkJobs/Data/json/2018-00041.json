The earlobes are elongated, indicating the heavy earrings once worn by Prince Siddhartha, who renounced all wealth to follow the path to enlightenment and become the Buddha.\r\nSoutheast Asia was situated on the trade routes from the Indian subcontinent to China from ancient times. Buddhism arrived in Java along these trade routes, and subsequently missionaries followed. Javanese devotees travelled to Nalanda University in Bihar, Northern India, establishing strong connections with Indian Buddhist centres. \r\n",
