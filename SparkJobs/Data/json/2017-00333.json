There are no signatures seen on the batik kain panjang.", "sgcool_label_text" : "The main design field of this kain panjang (or badan) is filled with finely drawn swirling tendrils, flowers and birds.  Black and red dyes are used to emphasise key motifs and create visual symmetry.  The artist, Oey Soen King also used filler motifs on the birds’ plummage leaf veins and flower petals, creating depth to the overall design.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Soen King (1861-1942), the first in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her batiks feature the classic layout typical of her time, and are embellished with Chinese traditional motifs.  These motifs include lotus flowers, centipedes and cloud motifs, which are rendered sensitively and imaginatively.  The combination of natural red and blue dyes on a cream ground is also characteristic of batiks made during this period in the north coast of Java, before the invention and widespread popularity of chemical dyes in batik sarongs by the late 19th century.  Oey Soen King’s pieces were all unsigned as signatures were not yet fashionable.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "Late 19th-early 20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan flower (motif) birds (motifs) foliage (motif)", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00333", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
