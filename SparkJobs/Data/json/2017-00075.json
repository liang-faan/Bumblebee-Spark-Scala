His jaw is ajar, revealing a set of sharp teeth. Depicted to be on all fours with the exception of his raised right palm, he tilts his head backwards and stares at the top right corner where a red circle is. Duchanee's paint strokes are strong, decisive and swift. Outlining only certain areas, he uses a combination of shading techniques to give the body of Hanuman its form. His head is fully coloured, and his palms have been realistically portrayed.", "sgcool_label_text" : "Thawan Duchanee is one of Thailand’s foremost artists and whose vivid and visceral interpretations of Buddhist teachings and visual motifs have won him international acclaim. \r\nDespite being an avowed Buddhist, Thawan has invoked the importance Hinduism has within Thai folk culture with his depiction of Hanuman, a central figure of the Ramayanan or Ramakien (in Thai). Popularly known as the Monkey God, Hanuman is in Hindu accounts, the incarnation or avatar of Shiva and represents divine strength, power and agility. Here in this painting, Thawan captures a chapter in the chronicles of Hanuman in which the monkey deity is ravenous with hunger and mistakes the sun for a ripened mango. As he chases the sun, the god Indra intervenes by striking Hanuman in the jaw, triggering a saga of retaliation from Hanuman’s father.\r\nHanuman was part of a renowned series of 14 paintings shown at his solo exhibition at the British Council in Bangkok in 1973. This work comes from a period just after Thawan’s paintings were slashed by students in 1971 for supposedly desecrating Buddhism as he had juxtaposed erotic, monstrous forms with the Buddha, and he was at the time residing at the Student Christian Centre which led to a misconception that Thawan was a sacrilegious Christian railing against Buddhist beliefs. The Ramayana series however did not cause the same controversy of his earlier works because the depicted subjects were monkeys and demons rather than Buddhism.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "British Council (Thailand)", "creator_1" : "Thawan Datchani, 1939-", "context_1" : "This painting was part of a solo exhibition held at the British Council in 1973 showing art that depicted characters from the Thai epic Ramakian.", "context_5" : "1973", "title_text" : "Hanuman", "creation_date" : "1973", "subject_terms_1" : "Hinduism gods (deities)  religious characters folk tales outlines (linear forms)", "context_4" : "1973", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00075", "shape" : "Rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Thailand", "subject_terms_2" : "Hinduism and culture Hindu gods Hanuman Folklore Faith in art", "context_3" : "1973", "techniques_name" : "oil painting (technique)  shading  dry-brush painting", "context_7" : "British Council (Thailand)"}
