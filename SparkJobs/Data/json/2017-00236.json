  "physical_appearance": "The painting depicts an Irian shaman with a stern, piercing look. In his arms are several birds; one of which appears to be about to take flight. The colour scheme gravitates towards earthly hues of dark green and brown, with the exception of the bright red and yellow strokes on the birds. The contrast of hues enhances the mysticism of the piece; especially with respect to the positioning of the foot as an arm on the right of the painting.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "As a sole female participant in PERSAGI (Persatuan Ahli Gambar Indonesia or Association of Indonesian Draftsmen) , Emiria Soenassa is a pioneering modern artist from Indonesia.  An Irian shaman with a mask-like face and piercing gaze is shown embracing the magical birds, with one of them abou to take flight.  The dreamy imaginative qualities of the work is emphasised through the stark contrast between dark and bright hues and the magical transformation of the man's hand to an earthy foot.  As a self-proclaimed princess from the island Sultanate of Tidore, Emiria advocated for Papuan independence from the Dutch.  Painted one year before the UN Roundtable Conference to discuss the handover of sovereignty over Papuan region from the Dutch to Indonesian government, this work may be associated with her political inclination.",
