This series is a contemporary take on traditional Peranakan porcelain or nyonyaware.  Hans Tan was inspired by batik, particularly the resist-dyeing technique, to transform the surface of these wares.  Original glazed portions are preserved in the form of a new dotted pattern while the white porcelain body is revealed after sandblasting away and erasing the original glaze on these pieces.  The combination of green and pink polychrome colours or dots on the original decoration of these pieces are typical of nyonyaware.  Motifs commonly found on nyonyaware would include realistically depicted birds and insects amongst floral sprays.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Candle holder", "creation_date" : "2012", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan  altar components  religious objects commissions (orders for works)", "creator_role" : "designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Contemporary (style of art)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00837", "shape" : "irregular ?", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik  Contemporary art  Geometry in art Reinterpreting history  Porcelain, Peranakan  Peranakan (Asian people)", "techniques_name" : "sandblasting  glazing (coating process)  throwing (pottery techniques)  molding (forming)  firing (technique)"}
