These concerns provide the critical contexts within which Chong’s intensive research and fieldwork in the area of Mt.

This trajectory of Chong’s practice is further demonstration of not only a vitally important strand of art-making in the region – one that is engaged with cultural worlds and registers of knowledge removed from the metropolitan centres – but also one that is responsive to critical issues still impacting the cultural lifeworlds of Southeast Asia today.\n",
