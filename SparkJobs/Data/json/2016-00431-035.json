Alan Oei (b. 1976\n Singapore) is an artist-curator interested in the workings between art history\n politics and community. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Art History from Columbia University and a Diploma in Fine Arts from Lasalle College of the Arts. Huang Wei – a fictional post-war painter of maimed children – is the alter-ego Oei uses to present his paintings. His work has been shown in Malaysia\n Hong Kong\n Melbourne and New York.
