The trousers are wide and loose-fitting, with a printed cotton floral waistband to secure the garment.   \r\n \r\nMajie is derived from a Shun Tak term (ma cheh) which means mother and sister. As this group of women had taken a vow never to marry, the term Majie alludes to their spinsterhood and refers to their work taking care of children. Majies took a vow of celibacy and sought to reflect the same purity and modesty in plain outfits. They typically wore a samfoo uniform consisting of a white mandarin-collar top and black trousers.  \r\n", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Majieâ€™s trousers with floral waistband", "creation_date" : "Mid-20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "trousers maids (servants) flower (motif)", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Chinese (culture or style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00894", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore", "subject_terms_2" : "Ethnic costume Household employees Motifs Pants", "techniques_name" : "sewing (needleworking technique)"}
