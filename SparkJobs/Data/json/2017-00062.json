A peony in bloom and a phoenix dominates the central circular medallion.  It is surrounded by floral sprays, and framed by an elephant, tiger, lion and qilin on the four corners.  Following the edges of this main square decoration are three borders of distinct decorative bands.  The innermost and outermost borders, like the main square silk fabric, are worked with silk floss in satin and voided satin stitches.  They contain auspicious Daoist symbols such as the double knot of happiness, conch and a pair of castanets.
