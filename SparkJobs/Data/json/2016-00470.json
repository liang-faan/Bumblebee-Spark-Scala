The other portrait shows Florence Yeo in a floral kebaya with a set of diamond kerosang made in the Melaka style. Both portraits are coloured photographs, bear the signature of the same artist and were probably made as a pair. Peter Lim owned a successful bee hoon manufacturing business and was known as the ‘Bee Hoon King’. He also built several markets, schools and houses. Lim Ah Pin Road and Florence Road were named after the couple, who owned and rented out several properties in the area.",
