  "sgcool_label_text": "Untitled incorporates numerous elements characteristic of Dusadee Huntrakul’s ceramic practice. While appearing unassuming, the sculpture’s curved contortions highlight the artist’s technical finesse with the medium. The porcelain rope seemingly defiant to the attraction of gravity lends the work a certain élan vital, and the work exudes an energy seemingly further amplified by two small egg-shaped pieces that rest upon the sculpture. What these “eggs” are are open to interpretation, and placement as well – and draw comparisons to a primordial cosmic egg, or when placed side-by-side, testicles as well. The wave motif present in other works from Dusadee also makes an appearance here. Now, in conjunction with the spheres, the waves seem to suggest the primordial nature of water, and it as a life force in itself.",
