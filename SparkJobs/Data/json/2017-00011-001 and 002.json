This uniform was designed by renowned French couturier Pierre Balmain\n and was first unveiled in 1968 when Singapore Airlines was still part of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA).  Balmain’s choice of batik print for the uniforms of both cabin crew and ground staff was a means for SIA to assert Malayan identity and hospitality.

Today\n this uniform is seen in four colours\n with each colour denoting the rank of the flight stewardess.\\r\\n\n",
