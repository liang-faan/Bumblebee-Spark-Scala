  "sgcool_label_text": "This drawing belongs to part of a collection of artefacts related to the World War II underground resistance movement known as Force 136. The collection of materials was gathered by Tan Chong Tee (1916- 2012), who was a key member of this resistance group. The collection consists of original materials belonging to Tan and other members of Force 136 dating from the 1940s to new materials reproduced from memory by Tan Chong Tee, which date from mid 1990s to early 2000s. \r\n\r\nForce 136 was set up in July 1942 as part of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). It recruited and trained local guerrillas to gather intelligence and create an underground spy network to support planned British invasion of Japanese-occupied Malaya.\r\n\r\nThis scroll depicts the trials undergone by members of Force 136 and drawn from the memory of Tan Chong Tee. The first part of the scroll (from right) depicts torturing of the members to force confessions out of them, fierce interrogation of Tan Chong Tee and him trying to outwit the Japanese. \r\n",
