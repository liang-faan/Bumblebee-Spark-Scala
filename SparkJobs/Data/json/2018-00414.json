They are gold in colour and arranged side by side in a tubular brown box. Each button has a floral design on its surface. Gemstones are embedded in the indentations caused by the floral designs. These gemstones are silver in colour.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This set of buttons are mounted in gold and set with flat-cut diamonds on a blue ground. The reverse sides are enamelled with polychrome floral designs. Blue buds with green leaves support several five-petalled, red flowers. \r\n\r\nThe buttons were intended to be attached to front of a sherwani, a knee length coat commonly worn in India in the late 1800s. A western adaptation, the sherwani became associated with the image of an elite and educated Indian man. Decorated sherwanis would have gem-studded buttons like these attached to them.",
