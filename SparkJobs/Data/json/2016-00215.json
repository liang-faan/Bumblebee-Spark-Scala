A separate school for girls – ‘Sardamani girls’ School’ was subsequently opened in 1937 and it was quickly filled to capacity. The mission established one of the earliest Tamil schools in Singapore. \\r\\nSeveral Tamil Schools were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These schools were located near the British bases in Seletar\n Sembawang and Changi where Tamils found employment. Much later\n these schools were discontinued because of the declining number of students due to Tamil families’ preference to send their children to English medium Schools. This is probably one of the earliest photographs available of the school.\n",
