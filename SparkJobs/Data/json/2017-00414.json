The motifs are further embellished with intricate secondary filler patterns. The right and left ends of the batik kain panjang is bordered by a repeated scrolling pattern. There is a signature on the bottom-left of the batik kain panjang.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "Phonexies amidst clouds (or the megamendung motif) divide the kain panjang into three vertical sections.  Although the entire design is set against a plain indigo blue background, the phoenixes’ plumage and tail feathers are rendered sensitively, emphasising their graceful flight.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This piece is signed “Hendromartono’s Batik Art” Unique Pekalongan Ind”.",
