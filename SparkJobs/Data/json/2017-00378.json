The left side of the kain panjang features birds perched on and flying amongst flowering branches. The right side of the kain panjang features fishes swimming amongst aquatic plants. The background of the kain is decorated with secondary geometric motifs.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This batik is structured in the pagi-sore format, comprising two different but related designs on each half of the kain panjang.  Birds perched on flowering branches occupy one side of this kain panjang while fishes swimming amidst aquatic plants and flowers are depicted on the other.  Two different background patterns are shown on each side although the entire design is set against a white ground.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.",
