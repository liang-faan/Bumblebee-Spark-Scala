It features two different but similar designs on each half of the kain panjang.

The right side of the kain panjang features a similar garden scene, with hydrageas, water lilies and swans. There is a signature at the top-left of the batik kain panjang.", "sgcool_label_text" : "This batik is structured in the pagi-sore format, comprising two different but related designs on each half of the kain panjang.  On both halves, scenes of a garden pond featuring swans, birds perched on trees, a walkway and bridge are depicted.  Within each motif, filler motifs are added to give the illusion of colour change and distance.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.
