Together with a team of scientists and a photographer\n Davis visited a century year old teak plantation on Muna Island in South Sulawesi where she met with the villagers of Muna. The components that comprise ‘Together Again (Wood:Cut) Part lll: Material’ are a meditation on the experience of visiting Muna\n and of the competing systems of knowledge the team encountered\n between the shamanistic insights of the villagers in Sulawesi and the scientific inquiry of DNA technology. More than a simple forensic ‘search for origins’ of a particular rainforest product\n the project opens on to a world in which the forces of magic has a deep significance to a community largely dependent on wood\n and becomes embroiled in the contestation between what kinds of knowledge are allowed to make claims over the understanding of reality.","createdDate":"20201018182636","version":0,"latest":false,"roles":[],"metadata":{"accession_no_csv":"2017-00515","Image":"","object_work_type":"prints (visual works)  woodcuts (prints)","title_text":"Banyan and Teak, Muna, Southeast Sulawesi, 2010","preference":"main","title_language":"","creator_2":"Lucy Davis","creator_role":"artists (visual artists)","creation_date":"2012","creation_place_original_location":"Singapore","inscriptions":"","inscription_language":"","shape":"Rectangular","materials_name":"paper (fiber product)  charcoal (material)  teak (wood)","techniques_name":"block printing (relief printing process)","object_colour":"black-and-white (colours)","physical_appearance":"This print depicts a banyan tree from a wormhole perspective.
