  "sgcool_label_text": "This cobalt blue bowl features flared walls and a slightly everted rim on a fairly flat base. It has been skilfully decorated with heart-shaped palmette motifs which feature scrolled ends curling inwards and a cross-hatched oval in the centre. This central pattern is bordered along the top and bottom by bands of successive wheel-cut facets, resulting in decoration that is bold and flamboyant. The precise execution of the cuts shows off the expertise and accomplished skills of its maker. This style of decoration is produced by bevelling the surface of the glass to the design, and has been termed as ‘slant-cut’ style.",
