In 1993, the National Museum became part of the National Heritage Board (NHB) and the national collection of paintings, archaeological wares, ethnographical and historic material were then split into three different museums. The Singapore History Museum was housed in the museum’s original premises at Stamford Road. Following the museum’s redevelopment in 2006, the institution was renamed as the National Museum of Singapore.",
