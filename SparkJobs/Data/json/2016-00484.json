In the station beside the one at the extreme right of the photograph, a train can be seen to be stationed there. The other stations are all empty. Several HDB flats can be seen in the background. Some cranes can be seen, but too distinctly, further away in the background towards the left side of the photograph. The extreme left and right sides of this photograph are slightly whitened out.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "\"This image was taken along Kampong Bahru Road, where the Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, or Keppel Station, was located. The Church of St. Teresa can be seen in the background. The church, featuring Romano-Byzantine architecture, was established in 1929, and it was the first rural Catholic Church in Singapore. This image is part of the \"\"Tracking Memories\"\" collection by the late Mr Kwek Leng Joo. The collection captures different aspects of the Malayan Railway story in Singapore",
