  "sgcool_label_text": "The works by Bounpaul Phothyzan go against the typical grain of contemporary thought and art production in Laos. ‘Red House’ is a photo installation that comprises 5-framed photographs and a red cloth-house sculpture. Three red cloth wrapped house-structures are photographed against a backdrop of rural Laotian landscape. Used to symbolize the three red ‘houses’ of communism in the region – China, Vietnam and Laos, this work casually accesses the influence of China and Vietnam in Laos through the documenting of its changing scenery. In one image, we can imagine ourselves bearing witness to the crude unfurling of sky rise buildings that Chinese investment companies have been backing in under-tapped Laos. The bizarreness of sky scrapers as they abruptly punctuate the horizon line are significant as a demonstration of how China is attempting to gain a footing into Southeast Asia: swiftly and crudely. The polished and poetic capturing of ‘Red House’ belies the expansive socio- and geo-political influences China and Vietnam have on Laos.",
