There are no signatures seen on the painting.", "sgcool_label_text" : "Working with the medium of painting for more than a decade now, Ruben Pang is a young Singaporean artist who has gained significant recognition for his abstract works. Paintings from Pang possess an almost musical quality – through his brushstrokes and erasure of the paint that has been applied, the colours presented upon his wood, canvas, or aluminum panels reflect the musical qualities of counterpoint and harmony, even as he delves into themes of apocalypse and chaos. \r\n\r\nType 0 Civilisation is a work inspired from Pang’s travels to Europe where he encountered works of western masters, such as, John Martin, Gerhard Richter, and Peter Paul Rubens.  Especially drawn to apocalyptic scenes, Type 0 Civilisation is Ruben Pang’s re-capturing of Peter Paul Rubens’ iconic work, The Fall of The Damned. Executing the work intuitively, Pang sought to extract the essence of the work from classical painterly principles of light and shadow. Contrasting the deliberate and planned methodologies utilized by Rubens, Type 0 Civilisation, like numerous of Pang’s other works was executed in a style that can be best described as a stream of consciousness. With no pre-determined goal in mind, Pang’s brushstrokes are led by intuition, reflex, and accident. \r\n\r\nThe work’s title references the expanded Kardashev scale, a system of measuring a civilization’s technical advancement based on its ability to harness and store energy. The original Kardashev scale ranges Type I, Type II, and Type III, each corresponding to planetary, stellar, and galactic civilisations; the expanded scale’s inclusion of a Type 0 references our planet’s current state of advancement. In this regard, one may perhaps draw a mirroring between the Archangel Michael’s casting of the fallen angels from the heavens and humanity’s current desire for technological advancement – where the unfettered thirst for power are paths leading to potential ruin. \r\n", "preference" : "main", "creator_1" : "Pang, Ruben", "edition_description" : "Unique", "title_text" : "Type 0 Civilization", "creation_date" : "2016-2017", "subject_terms_1" : "abstract (general art genre) symbolism (artistic concept) energy", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "accession_no_csv" : "2018-00600", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore (nation)", "subject_terms_2" : "Rubens, Peter Paul, 1577-1640 Symbolism Humanity Apocalypse in art Energy", "techniques_name" : "painting (image-making)"}
