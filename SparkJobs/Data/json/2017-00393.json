It features hexagon squares against a dark red background. Enclosed within each hexagon square is a stylised depiction of a variety of animals and plant forms. On the right of the batik there is a vertical row of elongated triangles. A vertical panel segments the triangles from the main body of the batik. Both the panel and the triangles also contain the stylised designs.", "sgcool_label_text" : "Curious animals and plant forms embellish this kain panjang.  Enclosed within squares with hexagon corners and elaborate borders, the layout of the badan (or ‘body’ and main design feature of the batik) emphasises the creativity of the artist.  On one end of the batik, a row of interlocking triangles, known as tumpal is shown.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This piece is signed “Jane Hendromartono Pekalongan Java”.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "1965-1980s", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan foliage (motif) depictions (visual works) cultural diffusion", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00393", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs Culture diffusion", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
