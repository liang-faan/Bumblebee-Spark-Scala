  "sgcool_label_text": "This box was used to store the beads and needles used for nyonya needlework. It has a picture on the cover surrounded by a border of scrolls. Seed beads are hallmarks of Peranakan needlework and were traditionally referred to as manek potong (cut beads) regardless of the types of beads at hand. Strings of beads could be unstrung before being categorised and placed into small bottles for use. Needles used for beadwork are nearly identical to those utilised in embroidery. The original owner of these items made a living fashioning beaded slippers and dresses, working from home as she did not have a shop.",
