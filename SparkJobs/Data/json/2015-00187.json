  "sgcool_label_text": "This cheongsam designed for the theatre is quite significant - intended for the actress in the role of a night club owner, the garment in red velvet with an elaborate sequinned motif - seems appropriate for the setting.  The high mandarin collar, raglan shoulder, sleeveless and a highly cut skirt is indicative of the role of a cabaret owner in her 40s.\r\nThe costume was tailored for Dr Margaret Chan who played the role of the cabaret owner. \r\nBeauty World, 1988 is among the most well known Singapore musicals.
