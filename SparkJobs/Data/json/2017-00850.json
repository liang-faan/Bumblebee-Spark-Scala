The wave is a recurring motif that features in numerous of Dusadee’s sculptures and drawings. Stemming from how this memorable visit was during the monsoon season, the choppy conditions of the sea left a deep impression on Dusadee. Furthermore, since the primary purpose of the visit to Phuket was for surfing, Dusadee had watched his brother conquer these towering waves with both trepidation and pride – the flaccid penis affixed to the sculpture sheds light on the fear that the artist experienced as he watched his brother.", "preference" : "main", "edition_description" : "Unique", "title_text" : "He Was Out There All Alone Riding The Monsoon Waves Like A Champ", "creation_date" : "2015", "subject_terms_1" : "fear memory  waves (natural events)  phalluses  symbolism (artistic concept)", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Contemporary (style of art)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00850", "shape" : "Rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Thailand", "subject_terms_2" : "Sculpture  Loss (Psychology)  Fear Memories  Waves  Phuket (Thailand)  Penis  Symbolism  Art, Thai", "techniques_name" : "sculpting"}
