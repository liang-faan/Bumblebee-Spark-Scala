First published in 1934, the comic strip was celebrated for its exotic storyline and science fiction theme.  Winged-men, horned villains and ferocious reptiles are rendered in a background of densely packed small curls (ukel).  Although the comic contains aggressive action and scantily-clad women, these are not reproduced on cloth.  Instead, the artist tames these characters and creatures by clothing them in textile patterns, and setting them in a benign floral setting.  The combination of natural soga brown and indigo dyes are favoured in central Java batik.  Both the batik's subject matter and laborious patterning are indicative of the owner's and artist's high economic status.  Unlike a sarong, a kain panjang is not sewn into a tube.  It is wrapped around the lower body, and then fastened by tucking in the folded ends of the kain at the waist.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang (hip wrapper)", "creation_date" : "1930", "subject_terms_1" : "comic strips motifs foliage (motif) Peranakan", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Javanese (culture or style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00648", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Jawa Tengah (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Ethnic costume Batik Flash Gordon (comic strip) Motifs Comics (Graphic works) Peranakan (Asian people)", "techniques_name" : "batik sewing (needleworking technique)"}
