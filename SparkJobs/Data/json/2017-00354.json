It features large bouquets of European flowers interspersed with butterflies and birds. The background is green, filled with dense fern-like leaves motif. The top of the batik features a scrolling floral pattern with blue background, while the bottom features the same pattern with a coral background. There is no signature seen on this batik sarong.", "sgcool_label_text" : "The buketan design, comprising large bouquets of European flowers interspersed with butterflies and birds, is repeated on this sarong.  The kepala (broad vertical panel) of this batik is set on a coral plain background while the badan (main design feature of the batik or ‘body’) is filled with dense fern-like motif.  The bouquet of tulips and orchids are repeated on both the kepala and badan, with slight variations in the colour combination of the flowers.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966), the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular, exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality, possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northern coast of Java by the Europeans.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Sarong", "creation_date" : "Early 20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan folk costume birds (motifs) foliage (motif) cultural diffusion flower (motif)", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00354", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs Culture diffusion", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
