The panel on left is decorated with swirling tendrils, floral blooms, butterflies and birds against a more intricate, smaller floral background. There are no signatures seen on this batik.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "The main design field (on the body or badan) of this batik is replete with swirling tendrils, floral blooms and birds.  The exuberance of this design is enhanced by tiny, creamy filler motifs, known as tanahan, which echo the main design thereby creating visual harmony.  The broad vertical panel (kepala) of this sarong comprises two large floral bouquets or the buketan design, and minutely decorated diagonal bands of motifs.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Soen King (1861-1942), the first in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her batiks feature the classic layout typical of her time, and are embellished with Chinese traditional motifs.  These motifs include lotus flowers, centipedes and cloud motifs, which are rendered sensitively and imaginatively.  The combination of natural red and blue dyes on a cream ground is also characteristic of batiks made during this period in the north coast of Java, before the invention and widespread popularity of chemical dyes in batik sarongs by the late 19th century.  Oey Soen Kingâ€™s pieces were all unsigned as signatures were not yet fashionable.",
