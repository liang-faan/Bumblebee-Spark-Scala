Apart from serving as a holder to rest a scholar’s brush or inkstick, this elephant is also a delightful example of a “scholar’s plaything”. The potter has imbued the elephant with life by modelling the animal’s trunk in an upturned and trumpet-like manner. The outline of the animal also takes the form of a double-gourd. The gourd was a popular motif in Chinese art as it was associated with longevity as well as protective and magical properties.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Brush-or ink- rest", "creation_date" : "1644-1911", "subject_terms_1" : "zoomorphic symbolism  Wen ren", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Qing (dynastic styles and periods)  Chinese ceramics styles", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00277-001 and 002", "shape" : "Irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "China", "subject_terms_2" : "Monochrome art  Porcelain, Chinese Ming- Qing dynasties, 1368-1912 Brush stands", "techniques_name" : "glazing (coating process)  throwing (pottery techniques)  underglazing molding (forming)  firing (technique)  carving (processes)"}
