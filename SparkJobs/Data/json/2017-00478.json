  "physical_appearance": "This pastel drawing features characters from Javanese wayang and mythology.  The colours are vibrant, and the strokes are fine. A yellow wheel dominates the central composition, while geomtric patterns encircle it. Each mythological character is depicted in a different colour; three are in the foreground whilst two are in flight.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This work features characters from the Javanese wayang and other forms of Javanese mythology. Like Apins’s series of batik works, we can see his engagement with local folklore and traditions, even combining their visual language with his modernist tendencies. This synthesis represents Apin’s steadfast pursuit of new artistic languages without necessarily doing away with his traditions.",
