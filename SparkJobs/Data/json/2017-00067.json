  "sgcool_label_text": "A dragon motif occupies the central lobed medallion, and is flanked by auspicious Daoist symbols--the fly whisk, fan, pair of castanets, and bamboo drum—similarly enclosed in lobed medallions.  The front- facing dragon was possibly inspired by Ming dynasty imperial court robes, with the dragon symbolising the emperor’s centrality in the universe.  Pencil outlines of the designs in the cartouches are evident where some beads have fallen off.",
