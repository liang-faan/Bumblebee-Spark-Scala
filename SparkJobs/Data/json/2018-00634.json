His paintings of old Singapore are especially important as they serve as a visual documentation of our national heritage. \r\nStarted painting at 10 and not being able to afford formal art training, Idris learnt from books, observation, practice and a brief tutelage under pioneer Malay artist, S. Mahdar.
