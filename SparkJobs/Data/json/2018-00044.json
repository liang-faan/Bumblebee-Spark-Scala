Teh’s works were captured in several surveys of art and contemporary sculpture in Singapore around the 1970s\n including ‘Colour’ at the National Museum Art Gallery (NMAG) in 1977\n  ‘Contemporary Singapore Sculpture’ at NMAG in 1978\n and the annual display of the permanent collection at NMAG from 1976 to 1979.

He sought to expand the possibilities for both sculpture and painting\n and created works using stacked\n shaped canvases and reliefs\n not unlike the artist Anthony Poon\n who created his relief paintings around the same time. This work is representative of Teh’s use of the cosmos as a recurrent motif\n informed by the artist’s interest in both the science fiction of HG Wells and his observations of technological advancements of the time.\n",
