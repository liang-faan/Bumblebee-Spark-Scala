  "sgcool_label_text": "In Rampant, Simryn Gill photographed bamboo, bananas, camphor laurels and sugar cane groves in northern New South Wales, Australia. The plants are dressed with lungis and sarongsâ€”garments from South and Southeast Asia, where many of these plants originated. Over time, these plants, once only found in South and Southeast Asia, became part of the Australian landscape. Some even came to be regarded as weeds that threaten the native flora, a point to which the title of the work alludes",
