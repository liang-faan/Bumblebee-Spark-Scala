  "sgcool_label_text": "These materials belong to Chan Phui Kong and consist of items which he used in guerrilla warfare as a member of the World War II underground resistance movement known as Force 136.  They form part of a larger collection of materials gathered by Tan Chong Tee (1916- 2012), who was a key member of this resistance group. The collection consists of original materials belonging to Tan and other members of Force 136 dating from the 1940s to new materials reproduced from memory by Tan Chong Tee, which date from the late 1980s to early 2000s.\r\n\r\nForce 136 was set up in July 1942 as part of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE).
