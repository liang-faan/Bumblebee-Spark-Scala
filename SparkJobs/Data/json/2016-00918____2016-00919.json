  "sgcool_label_text": "This white ground enameled bowl is dated to the Daoguang (1821-1850) period. It is therefore a predecessor to “nyonyaware”, the porcelain that is more often associated with Peranakan taste by the turn of the 20th century. According to descendents, the white pieces were used as part of a larger dining set and on the altar in the house of Tan Kim Seng.\r\n\r\nThis bowl is part of a group of porcelain and jewellery from Panglima Prang, the ancestral home of prominent businessmen and philanthropists, Tan Kim Seng (1805-1864) and Tan Jiak Kim (1859-1917).",
