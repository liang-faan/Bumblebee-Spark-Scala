The works combine the growing influence of collage with an early experimentation with using lighting as a medium. As collages of various layers of coloured paper\n the works are also abstract\n in line with the vogue of abstract art at that time. The abstract form and the effort to expose the collage process through lighting provides visual intrigue and elicits more thinking on the part of the viewer on composition and method.
