Interspersed with butterflies and birds. There is a signature on the top-right of the batik. There is a small dark stain in the center-right of the batik.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "Pastel pink and lilac synthetic dyes are applied to the badan (‘body’ or main design field of the batik) and kepala (broad vertical panel) respectively.  The buketan design, comprising large bouquets of European flowers interspersed with butterflies and birds, is repeated on this kain panjang.  In fact, the badan and kepala are very similar on this piece, with only slight variation in the type and colour of the filler motifs used in the secondary floral design.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966), the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular, exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality, possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northern coast of Java by the Europeans.  This piece is signed “Nj Oey Kok Sing “.",
