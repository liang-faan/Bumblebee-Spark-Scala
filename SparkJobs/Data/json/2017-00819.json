  "sgcool_label_text": "Wong Keen (b. 1942) is regarded as a leading painter whose practice is often framed as the outcome of distilling and re-enervating eastern and western art genres. His oil paintings are marked by gestural and expressive brushwork, reinforcing affiliations with American abstract expressionism that shaped his formative years in New York; his paint handling also acknowledges debt to his grounding and fervor for calligraphy and Chinese ink particularly of the xieyi school.  \r\n\r\nWhile this work was produced during Wong’s student years, it is important to note that Wong was actively exhibiting and excelling during these ‘school years’. He was the recipient of the Ford Foundation tuition scholarship just a year earlier, in 1964; and the year this work was made was the year he won the Edward G. McDowell Travelling Scholarship – marking the first for a Singaporean recipient. The latter scholarship allowed Wong to travel to Europe and London.  \r\n Wong had been tutored by Liu Kang and mentored intensively by Chen Wen Hsi. He participated in local exhibitions from 1956, with a solo exhibition at the National Library in 1961 before leaving for the USA, enrolling at the Art Students League of New York (1961-65) and later St Martin’s School of Art London (entered in 1966). He excelled in school and actively exhibited, receiving the Ford Foundation tuition grant in 1964 and the Edward G. McDowell Travelling Scholarship the following year that enabled him to tour Europe and the UK. He took on art related jobs including as an art instructor and art director in New York and continued to paint - winning the Consul-Gen of Japan Award in 1967, In the late 1970s he established a frame shop Keen’s Gallery and eventually an art gallery for emerging artists. He returned to art professionally and began to exhibit in Singapore.",
