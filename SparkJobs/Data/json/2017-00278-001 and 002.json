This panelled style of decoration is widely seen on Vietnamese ceramic boxes produced in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The development of Vietnamese blue and white ceramics was spurred by the Chinese occupation of north Vietnam from 1407 to 1428 and the decline of Chinese porcelain exports during the fifteenth century.  Vietnamese potters were quick to capitalise on the gap and became prolific producers of blue and white wares, which they exported to overseas consumers in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Blue and white covered box", "creation_date" : "15th to 16th century", "subject_terms_1" : "cultural diffusion geometric shape  porcelain paintings (visual works)  exports freehand drawings (drawings)  symbolism  flower (motif)", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Vietnamese (culture or style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00278-001 and 002", "shape" : "concave", "creation_place_original_location" : "Vietnam", "subject_terms_2" : "Porcelain, Chinese Ming- Qing dynasties, 1368-1912 Blue and white ware China China painting  Floral decorations  Geometry in art Porcelain, Vietnamese", "techniques_name" : "glazing (coating process)  throwing (pottery techniques)  underglazing molding (forming)  firing (technique)  porcelain painting (image-making) freehand drawing (technique)"}
