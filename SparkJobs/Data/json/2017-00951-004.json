The project was conceived in 2014, the year of the elections in Indonesia when nationalist rhetoric dominated public consciousness, Artist collective Krack Studio sifted through a mass of research and archival material, eventually selecting 24 images that referenced the idea of the Indonesian Dream and \/ or told an interesting story about changing definitions of the ‘Nation’. Ranging from political posters to advertisements, comic strips, movie posters and magazines, these images, reconstructed and re-imagined by the artist collective, chronicle Indonesia’s evolving aspirations, desires and identity, as well as how Indonesia has been perceived and imaged for the ‘Western’ gaze.",
