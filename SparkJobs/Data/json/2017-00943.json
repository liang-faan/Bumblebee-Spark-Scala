Above him, is a plaque with the words INRI, and beneath his feet is the image of a skull. The sides of the cross are decorated with scrolling foliage motifs and symbols of the Passion of Christ. A figure of the Virgin Mary praying with her hands clasped is found on the other side. There are knobs on the bottom and on the arms of the cross.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This crucifix pendant is actually a reliquary. The knob at the bottom of the cross unscrews and panels on both sides open to reveal small compartments. Relics and other valuable items could be stored within. \r\n\r\nOn one side, there is a figure of Christ Crucified. On the other side is a figure of the Virgin Mary. The blooms below her feet are unusual and quite interesting: they appear to be a chrysanthemums, a flower popular in Japanese decorative arts. This crucifix reliquary was, in fact, made in Japan, perhaps for Western Christian missionaries working there. The decoration was made with a technique called sawasa, which involves applying lacquer to a gilded metal surface, then both incising and adding raised relief decoration to create stunning contrasts in black and gold. \r\n",
