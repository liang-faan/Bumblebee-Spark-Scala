There is a lorry situated towards the left hand side of the foreground of the photograph. Two male workers are standing on the lorry while another two are on the ground. One of them has lifted the bale of rubber over his head. The two workers on the lorry are attempting to take the load from him to place it on the lorry. There are already several bales of rubber stacked on the lorry. Low-level buildings are present at the background.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "Loke Hong Seng (b. 1943) was working as a radio announcer with Radio Television Singapore in the 1960s when he picked up photography and subsequently grew to specialize in street photography. His images of 1960s and 1970s Singapore offer a candid view of everyday life in the early days of the nation’s development. This photograph is one of Loke’s earliest photographs, taken using a Rolleicord camera borrowed from a colleague. It depicts some workers loading bales of rubber onto a lorry at Clarke Quay.",
