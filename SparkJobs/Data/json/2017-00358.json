It features a large bouquet of flowers interspersed with butterflies and birds as a repeated pattern across the batik. On the left, there is a panel with a pink background, decorated with small flowers. The main body of the batik sarong has a blue background, decorated with flower blossoms and leaves.", "sgcool_label_text" : "A large bouquet, a motif known as buketan or ‘bouquet’, is shown on the fuchsia pink, broad vertical panel (kepala) of this sarong.  The same buketan motif is repeated on the lilac blue “body” (badan) of the sarong, although it is set against a ground of single blossoms, leaves and birds in flight.  The bright colours used on this piece was possible because of the use of synthetic dyes.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966), the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular, exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality, possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northen coast of Java by the Europeans.  This piece is signed “Nj Oey Kok Sing”.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Sarong", "creation_date" : "20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan folk costume birds (motifs) foliage (motif) cultural diffusion", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00358", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs Culture diffusion", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
