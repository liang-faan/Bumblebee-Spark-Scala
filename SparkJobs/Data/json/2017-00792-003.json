  "sgcool_label_text": "Born in Vietnam in 1975 and brought up in Denmark, Danh Vo’s conceptual artworks and installations often draw upon elements of personal lived experience (his own, the lives of his parents and other family members) to explore broader historical, social or political themes, particularly those relating to the history of Vietnam at the close of the twentieth century. The photos were taken by Joseph Carrier, an American working in Vietnam. Like the objects owned by McNamara and JFK in Danh’s Mother Tongue show, or Martin Wong’s possessions in IMU UR2, the acquisition and appropriation of the photos become part of the work. That is, the history of the object matters. Here, meaning slides between US involvement in Vietnam, Carrier’s history and Danh’s own history.",
