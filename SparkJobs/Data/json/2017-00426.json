The coloured birds are drawn in a variety of positions with different uncoloured background motifs. The cloth is slightly stained.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "Fabric templates were used to guide the embroiderer. Drawn in a lively manner, each bird is surrounded by a dense square of ferns and flowers. These creatures are fantastical inventions, with peacock feathers for tails and bodies that are painted blue, green and yellow.\r\n\r\nAs pre-prepared template patterns were typically repetitive and conventional, this example stands out for the variety of animated postures and flora depicted. Pre-prepared patterns could be purchased and were popular because they could be used with beads, silk floss or a combination of different materials.\r\n",
