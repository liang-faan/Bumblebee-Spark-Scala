The antenna does not seem to be extendable or shortened. The 12-key telephone keypad looks slightly worn out, with several keypads having numbers and letters which are faded. The structure of the phone is elongated and it is not sleek. There are nine more keys below the 12-key telephone keypads. The brand name of the cellular phone is not displayed on the front of the phone. A blank LED screen is located above the 12-key telephone keypads. There are no visible cracks on the phone.",
