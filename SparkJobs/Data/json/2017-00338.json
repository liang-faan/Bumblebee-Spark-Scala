The design features a row of elongated triangles at both ends, against a dark background with rosette patterns.

There are no signatures seen on this batik kain panjang.", "sgcool_label_text" : "A lattice of diamond rhombuses each containing an animal or mythical creature forms the main design field (badan) of this batik.  Swastika (banji) and rosette designs form this grid.  On each end of the batik, a row of opposing triangles (tumpal) are depicted, forming the spilt kepalas.  Floral and leaf motifs are depicted in each of the triangles.  A panel similarly consisting of floral designs separates the tumpal from badan.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Soen King (1861-1942), the first in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her batiks feature the classic layout typical of her time, and are embellished with Chinese traditional motifs.  These motifs include lotus flowers, centipedes and cloud motifs, which are rendered sensitively and imaginatively.  The combination of natural red and blue dyes on a cream ground is also characteristic of batiks made during this period in the north coast of Java, before the invention and widespread popularity of chemical dyes in batik sarongs by the late 19th century.  Oey Soen Kingâ€™s pieces were all unsigned as signatures were not yet fashionable.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "Late 19th-early 20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan flower (motif) birds (motifs) foliage (motif) geometric motifs", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00338", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
