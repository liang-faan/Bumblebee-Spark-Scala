Interspersing the image and peppered throughout the print are geometric patterns. The bottom half of the print is predominantly yellow, while the top half is white.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This work is an interesting study of Apin’s steadfastness in searching for new visual languages. Often called the ‘Father of Graphic Art’ in Indonesia this work features the female nude, a series that he would go on to develop in his last paintings between 1990-1993 titled ‘Provocative Bodies’. \r\n\r\nThis work is also an important reference for the Bandung art scene in the 1970s where there were many artists pushing the boundaries of this art medium. Most of these artists came from ITB where Apin was teaching at that time. Their names include Kaboel Suadi, T. Sutanto, A.D. Pirous, Priyanto S. and others.",
