  "sgcool_label_text": "This batik is structured in the pagi-sore format, comprising two different but related designs on each half of the kain panjang.  On one side of the cloth, a garden scene is depicted complete with flowering branches, fowls and goldfishes.  On the other half, lanterns hang on branches of pink and blue flowers.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This piece is signed “Batik Kesenian Liem Siok Hien Kudus”.",
