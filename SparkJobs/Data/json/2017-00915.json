The paintings are rectangular in shape and there are circular arched walls above all of them. The paintings depict the same subject matter and all three of them consist of many colours. The shape and form of flowers can be discerned from the images. A piano set can be seen at the left hand side of the photograph.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "In Istana Garden, Sarkasi Said has composed a symphony of vibrant colours inspired by the lush flora of the Istana garden. Conducted with energy and vigour, the colours harmonise, expressing the vitality of the tropical island of Singapore. Drawing his inspiration from the verdant flora in the Istana garden, the artist proposed an abstract rendering of the Cattleya orchid – the largest hybridised Orchid to be found in Singapore – on the batik medium. Sarkasi’s views the various varieties of plant-life are symbols of warmth and harmony; the vigorous growth of tropical flora an intimation of communal comity. Furthermore, the orchid serves as a symbol of an extension of friendship between countries in the Singaporean diplomatic context.",
