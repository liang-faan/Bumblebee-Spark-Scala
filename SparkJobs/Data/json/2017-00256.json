When Francis Xavier was travelling between the islands of Ambon and Seram on his evangelizing mission, his ship encountered a storm, and Francis lost his crucifix in the rough waters. The ship managed to dock safely. Just then a crab appeared holding the crucifix in its claws, returning it to Francis Xavier. \r\nThis is one of the most popular episodes from the life of the saint, and served as inspiration for many artworks after his death. From the panelâ€™s size and high quality of carving, it was likely commissioned for a church. \r\n", "preference" : "main", "context_21" : "Goa, India", "title_text" : "Relief panel depicting St Francis Xavier", "creation_date" : "17th century", "subject_terms_1" : "reliefs (sculptures)  religious art Roman Catholicism  religious characters  missionaries Jesuit (Christian order)  parables religious visual works religious symbolism", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "European  Indian (South Asian)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00256", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Velha Goa (India)", "subject_terms_2" : "Religious art Christian art and symbolism Jesuit Missions Saints  Ceram Island (Indonesia)  Ambon Island (Indonesia)", "techniques_name" : "gilding (technique)  panel painting (image-making) carving (proceses)  relief (sculpture technique)"}
