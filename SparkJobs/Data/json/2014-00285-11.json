There are a couple of pedestrians and a cyclist on that road, together with numerous cars, jeeps, and trucks. Some of the vehicles are moving while others are parked. Several small boats are in operation and people can be seen rowing on these boats. In the background towards the left, a roofed building serves as bridge, connecting the road to the body of water.",
