Different colours are used on the different islands, ranging from pink to turquoise to yellow. The map is separated into a larger part and a smaller one. There are two different sets of scales used in this map. On the upper right hand corner of the map which is the smaller part, the scale of 1 : 45 is used. The larger part of the map utilizes the scale of 1 : 60. Straight black lines that run diagonal, vertical, and horizontal extend out from the two compasses that are located in both parts of the map.",

This chart of Maluku (or the Moluccas) and its neighbouring islands was published in that work.",
