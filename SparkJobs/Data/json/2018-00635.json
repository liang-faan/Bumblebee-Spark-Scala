  "sgcool_label_text": "Known for his watercolour landscapes and street scenes, Idris Mohamed Ali’s works reveal a strong understanding of colour, depth and realism. His paintings of old Singapore are especially important as they serve as a visual documentation of our national heritage. \r\nStarted painting at 10 and not being able to afford formal art training, Idris learnt from books, observation, practice and a brief tutelage under pioneer Malay artist, S. Mahdar. In 1962, at the age of 18, this self-taught artist had his first group exhibition at the Singapore Victoria Memoral Hall.\r\n",
