Several contexts may be forged in assessing her work – as the rare female presence in the male-dominated art scene of the 1960s and 70s that could be framed comparatively with Lai Foong Moi (1931-1994) and Sunyee (1919-2009); as a practitioner of faux naïve painting and printmaking; as a founding member of the seminal Ten Men Art Group (later the SEAsian Art Association) and her relationships with a notable network of artists that included her brother\n the artist Tan Teo Kwang.  \\r\\n \\r\\nChen was trained at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (1950-54)\n where she studied under Cheong Soo Pieng and Lim Hak Tai as well as calligraphy under Chui Ta Tee. Her classmates included Lim Yew Kuan and Choo Keng Kwang. She was fluent in Chinese\n English and French – working as the Bank of China’s interpreter for 20 years. Her ‘signature style’ is marked by flat\n rudimentary rendering and a marked simplicity in form and colour. This faux naïve sensibility seemed particularly suited for her subjects that included folk communities and cultures in the region.
