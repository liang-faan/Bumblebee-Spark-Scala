This interesting set of prints was essentially the artists’ interpretation of noted Surrealist poet, Paul Eluard’s poem Liberte. Consisting of the ‘who’s who’ of the ‘Bandung School’ of artists, this folio of prints can be seen both as an experimental publication in terms of the art-literary collaboration, and also the promotion of the print-making medium within the Indonesian context.",
