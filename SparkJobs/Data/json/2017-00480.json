  "sgcool_label_text": "This work continues Apinâ€™s exploration in the print technique. However beyond the print medium, there are also photographic and abstraction elements, combined with his lifelong study of the nude body. Hence this is a strong, confident work of an artist who is at the peak of his practice. To add to the multi-layered aspect of this work, the title Menenun which translates to Weaving also touches on the long-standing textile tradition in Indonesian besides of course, summarizing the technique of this work.",
