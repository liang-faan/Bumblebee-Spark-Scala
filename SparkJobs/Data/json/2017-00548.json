The things he chooses are intended to be reflective of time and space: unique to the localities in which he finds them, each object has its own story to tell of the communities it was found in. Once the artist has painstakingly replicated each found article into a detailed paper reproduction of the original items, the original value of these items in the economic context is replaced with an art object, its uselessness imbued with renewed meaningfulness. Each piece takes up to 4 four days to create, and Hirokiâ€™s execution is simultaneously and exercise in translation and self-reflection.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Rubbish", "creation_date" : "2016", "subject_terms_1" : "waste replication (image-making processes) refuse disposal", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00548\r\n", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore (?)
