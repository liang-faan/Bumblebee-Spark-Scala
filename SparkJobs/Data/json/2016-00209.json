The double-baluster stem supports five candleholders shaped like lotuses. Candelabra were made for dining tables in Europe and America. However, much of the design and decoration of this object is distinctly Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe form of this candelabra was made in copper, which was then coated with pigments containing ground glass. The object was then fired to create a bright glassy coating. In the 18th century, this type was production for foreign export in Guangzhou (Canton), with the result that the type is often called Canton enamel.",
