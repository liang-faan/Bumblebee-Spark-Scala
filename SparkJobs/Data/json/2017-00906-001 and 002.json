  "sgcool_label_text": "This covered bowl with under-glaze blue, iron red, and gold decoration was made at kilns in Arita, Japan. Porcelain with this combination of colours has come to be called “Imari ware” (after the Japanese port city from which it was exported). These wares became popular in Europe in the late 17th century, via the trade of the Dutch East India Company. They brought in Japanese ceramics when Chinese production fell because of political instability.",
