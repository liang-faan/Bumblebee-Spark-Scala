  "sgcool_label_text": "This walking stick is inscribed with the name of the city of Vigan, a significant port in the North of the Phillippines. It is dated 1882, when the city was controlled by a Spanish colonial government.  It bears the name Francisco Carlos Corrales, a Spaniard who must have bought it or received it as a gift or momento. He probably brought it back with him to Spain where it remained for over a century. Given the fine materials and workmanship it clearly was meant for the use of a wealthy gentleman.",
