  "sgcool_label_text": "Conventionally, Quranic manuscripts are presented as single volumes or as a thirty-part series where each volume is called a juz. However, this Quran copy has been unusually bound in three volumes. The main folios contain 11 lines of text in black. The script used is a distinctly Chinese script style inspired by the tapering brushstroke forms in traditional Chinese calligraphy, known as sini.  Each volume features different polychrome and gold illumination on the first and final bifolios. The illumination is predominantly composed of floral motifs and has been painted in a most refined and sophisticated manner. The richness of these motifs echo Chinese embroidery on silk.",
