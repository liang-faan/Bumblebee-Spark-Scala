  "physical_appearance": "This is a batik kain panjang. The left of the kain panjang features a panel with a lighter background, bordered by repeated florals on scrolling tendrils. The main body of the kain panjang has green with starburst rosettes. The floral bouquet motif is repeated across the kain panjang, with birds and butterflies flying over them. There is a signature on the top left of the kain panjang.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "The buketan (or ‘bouquet’) motif is repeated on the main design field (badan) and broad vertical panel (kepala) of this batik.  A variety of intricate motifs are used to fill in the main buketan motif and background, creating a lively and harmonious design.  Starburst rosettes enhance the buketan on the badan.  On the kepala, swirling tendrils echo the elegant twists in the floral branches.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966), the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular, exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality, possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northern coast of Java by the Europeans.  This piece is signed “Nj Oey Kok Sing”.",
