He was also regarded as a leading master in the context of the modern Asian art, and was widely considered to be one of the most successful living Chinese artists. 3.5.62 is a good example of Zao's early abstract imagery. As shown in this example, Zao's abstract schema is often framed within stable and simplified structures sectioned by horizontal segments. In the middle of the composition, forces and tensions are generated by layered interweaving colours and brushstrokes, which echo atmospheric energy and natural momentum. The imagery denotes the spiritual essence of the landscape-and-mountain painting in the tradition of Chinese art.", "preference" : "main", "creator_1" : "Zao, Wou-ki, 1920-2013", "title_text" : "3.5.62", "creation_date" : "1962", "subject_terms_1" : "abstraction", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00583", "shape" : "Rectangular", "subject_terms_2" : "Art, Abstract Ink painting, Chinese", "techniques_name" : "oil painting (technique)"}
