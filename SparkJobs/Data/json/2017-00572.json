Gregory Halili (b. 1975\n Manila\n the Philippines) carves and paints mother-of-pearl shells\n creating memento moris. He received his BFA from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and spent 25 years in the USA before returning to the Philippines. His work focuses on the art of miniatures\n and he is interested in notions of memory\n life\n death and cycles.
