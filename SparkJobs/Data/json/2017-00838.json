Original glazed portions are preserved in the form of a new dotted pattern while the white porcelain body is revealed after sandblasting away and erasing the original glaze on these pieces.  The combination of green and pink polychrome colours or dots on the original decoration of these pieces are typical of nyonyaware.  Motifs commonly found on nyonyaware would include realistically depicted birds and insects amongst floral sprays.\n",
