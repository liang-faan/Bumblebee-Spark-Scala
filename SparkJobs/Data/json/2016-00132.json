  "sgcool_label_text": "The title on the booklet states, ‘Funds raised in aid of Sim Teow Kwang’s children’ and is dated to the 2nd month of the Guimo year (1943). It contained two lists that track donations right up to 1945. The first list is a detailed account of the sums of cash from regular donor Tan Eng Seng and the second is a long list of names of the ordinary folk who contributed cash in various amounts to the three Sim children (one boy, aged 13 and two girls, aged 11 and 9) who were orphaned during the Japanese Occupation period. Before the war, the family was living along Tank Road. Their father, Sim Teow Kwang, was working with the Foreign Exchange Department of OCBC Bank. When Singapore fell, Mr Sim was taken away in February 1942 by Japanese soldiers, who had gathered all residents from Tank Road, River Valley Road and Clarke Quay at River Valley Road, where Liang Court is situated today. A few months later, on 8th September 1942, Mrs Sim passed away due to an illness. After their parents died, the children went to live with Tan Eng Seng, their maternal uncle. \r\nMany of those who contributed to the fundraising effort (comprising extended family members, neighbours and friends) had Sim as their family name. The record served as material proof of community self-help during this darkest chapter of Singapore’s history.",
