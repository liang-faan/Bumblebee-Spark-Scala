The turquoise blue jacket is embroidered with a variety of auspicious flowers such as chrysanthemum and Buddha hand citron. An elaborate scalloped border adorns its edges. The matching skirt with pleats is similarly decorated with floral patterns. A phoenix is depicted in a landscape of peonies and butterflies on the central panel. The bride wore turquoise or green-coloured wedding robes on the twelfth and last day of wedding celebrations.\r\n\r\nPeranakan wedding practices closely resembled old wedding customs in Fujian province, from which many Peranakans hail. For Peranakans living in Malacca and Singapore, wedding robes were often specially ordered from Shanghai or made by Shanghainese tailors living in Singapore.\r\n",
