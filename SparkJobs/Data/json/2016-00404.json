  "sgcool_label_text": "In Singapore, the kopitiam or coffee shop is a place where people meet, socialise, chit-chat and gossip over a cup of freshly-brewed coffee, half-boiled eggs and kaya toast. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the kopitiam had its signature ubiquitous furniture set, comprising a wooden table with marble table top such as this table, and wooden chairs with round seats. The tables varied in terms of the tableâ€™s legs, and the different shaped marble table tops which were round, square or hexagonal. Such hardy tables have been mostly replaced by plastic tables which are lightweight, and can be moved around easily or sometimes collapsed to save space.",
