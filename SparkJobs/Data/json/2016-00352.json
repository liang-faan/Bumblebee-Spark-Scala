Manila shawls were popular in Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries, especially in Spain. They are usually worn covering the shoulders or as a mantilla covering the heads of women. Made of silk and produced in China, they were brought to European shores through trade routes earlier established by the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade (1565–1815). Although the shawls were made in China, they were usually shipped to Europe via Manila on the galleons, hence the misnomer, “Manila shawls”.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Manila shawl", "creation_date" : "1930s", "subject_terms_1" : "exports flower (motif) leaf scrolls birds (motifs)", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00352", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Guangzhou (China)", "subject_terms_2" : "Shawls exports Embroidery Motifs", "techniques_name" : "embroidering"}
