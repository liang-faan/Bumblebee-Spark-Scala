  "sgcool_label_text": "Prior to the World War II period, Indians in Singapore and Malaya retained strong political, sentimental and economic ties with their home country. Anti-colonial thoughts and actions, inspired by the “call for freedom” in India, resonated in the region too. Radio broadcasts, newspaper reports and visits by nationalist leaders strengthened the nationalistic mood among the migrant Indian community. The Indian National Army and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose brought to the fore this spirit of nationalism. This collection provides rare documentary evidence of the involvement of the region's Indian community in the Indian National Army and the Indian Independence League, the army's fund raising arm. This is a group of war time photographs, newspapers, magazines and ephemera collected by the sixth president of Singapore, Mr.S.R.Nathan.",
