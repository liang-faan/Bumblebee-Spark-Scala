This is crowned by a gable filled with carvings of flowers and vines against a speckled background. With its features inspired by European architecture, this mirror is a modest example of Peranakan hybrid tastes. Teak furniture whose designs were inspired by English styles was popular among Peranakans since the late 19th century. This mirror came from the collection of Botan House, the ancestral home built by Tan Kim Tian in 1883 at the corner of Neil Road and Craig Road (since demolished).", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Mirror", "creation_date" : "Late 19 - early 20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "carvings (visual works) Peranakan cultural diffusion furniture", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00935", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore", "subject_terms_2" : "Mirrors Culture diffusion Peranakan (Asian people) Furniture", "techniques_name" : "woodcarving"}
