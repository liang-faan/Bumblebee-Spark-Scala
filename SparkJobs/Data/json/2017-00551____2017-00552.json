However\n the works by Lao and Siong blend Hmong customs and culture through the use of textile motifs with figures and compositions that are uniquely their own. In her three works\n Siong utilises a variety of design motifs that are typical of Hmong embroidery and story clothes: for example\n the triangles that border her panels symbolise mountains\n while the cluster of five circles with a dot in each symbolises a peacock ocellus. Particular to Siong’s repertoire of textile artworks are the lanky creatures that feature prominently on each panel. In the context of the animistic beliefs of the Hmong people\n they represent ‘shadows’\n ‘spirits’ or ‘souls’\n which Lao as shaman distinguishes and names. To describe these panels – with their whimsical colours and seemingly childlike simplicity – as art brut\n folk or naïve art would not be incorrect. But critical to their reception is also the recognition that these artworks reflect on the language of ‘self and society’ and the ‘spiritual and physical’ realms as perceived and experienced within the traditions and belief systems of contemporary Laos.","createdDate":"20201018182636","version":0,"latest":false,"roles":[],"metadata":{"accession_no_csv":"2017-00551\r\n2017-00552","Image":"","object_work_type":"tapestries textile art (visual works)","title_text":"Spirit of Sky and Earth 3  Spirit of Sky and Earth 4  Spirit of Sky and Earth 3 and Spirit of Sky and Earth 4 tapestries","preference":"alternate alternate main","title_language":"","creator_2":"Tcheu Siong","creator_role":"artists (visual artists)","creation_date":"2016","creation_place_original_location":"Laos","styles_periods_indexing_terms":"Hmong (culture or style)","inscriptions":"","inscription_language":"","shape":"rectangular","materials_name":"cloth","techniques_name":"sewing (needleworking technique) embroidering","object_colour":"multicolored","physical_appearance":"This is a set of two hanging tapestries.
