  "physical_appearance": "This is a batik kain panjang. It features large bouquets of European flowers interspersed with butterflies and birds. On the left of the batik, there is a panel with a green background, decorated with small flowers. The main body of the batik has a pink background, densely decorated with floral blooms. There are some several holes in the batik, especially in the center.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "The buketan design, comprising large bouquets of European flowers interspersed with butterflies and birds, is repeated on this kain panjang.  On the kepala (broad vertical panel of the batik), the single buketan motif is set against the plain green ground and decorated with tiny stemmed flowers.  The ‘body’ or badan is in pink and is filled with a denser background pattern of single blooms.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966), the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular, exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality, possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northern coast of Java by the Europeans.  This piece is stamped “Oeij Kok Sing 12 Aug 40”.",
