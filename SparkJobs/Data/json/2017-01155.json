The palette is dull, and stands in contrast to the bright orange-red of the fire. A road leads to the temple, and several figures are depicted to be trekking that path. This painting is framed by a dark brown frame. The artist's signature can be found on the bottom left corner.",

Upon Ba Nyanâ€™s recommendation, he was appointed as an art instructor at the State School of Fine Arts in Yangon, a position he held for ten years. The name 'Bogalay' was often used by him to highlight the importance of his birthplace. Proficient in both oils and watercolour, he is most known for landscapes with his characteristic use of cerulean blue and night scenes.",
