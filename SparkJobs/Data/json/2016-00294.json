He also holds a golden mace, a conch shell, a discus and the lotus flower he usually holds is tucked into his yellow dhoti. He is attacking the demon Hayagiva who emerges from a conch-shell, and holds up a golden mace and a shield to protect himself.\r\n\r\nMatsya, which means fish in Sanskrit, is Vishnuâ€™s first avatar, or incarnation. Hayagriva had stolen the ancient Vedas from Brahma, and hidden them in the ocean. Therefore Vishnu takes the form of a great fish to kill Hayagriva and retrieve the vedas, signified by the manuscript in his hand.\r\n",
