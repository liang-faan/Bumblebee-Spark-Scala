  "sgcool_label_text": "This piece was specially created to celebrate SG50, Singapore's 50th year of independence, in 2015 and it was inspired by the William Farquhar collection of natural history drawings from the National Museum of Singapore. Farquhar was the first Resident and Commandant of Singapore, and the 477 watercolours from the collection were commissioned by him when he served as British Resident and Commandant of Melaka from 1803 to 1818. The drawings combine traditional Chinese painting methods with European, providing an insight into the local flora and fauna, as well as a glimpse into the history of British rule in the Malay Peninsula during the early 19th century.",
