  "sgcool_label_text": "The bodhisattva is seated in a posture of royal ease on a recumbent lion. The androgynous figure is adorned with elaborate, royal jewellery, and with a tiny figure of Amitabha Buddha seated in the headdress.\r\nThe presence of Amitabha Buddha identities the figure as Guanyin or Avalokiteshvara. The presence of the lion refers to its roar, “Simhanada”, symbolising the force of Enlightenment. Depictions of Simhanada Avalokiteshvara developed in India around the eleventh or twelfth century, and appeared as Shi Hou Guanyin in China during the twelfth century.\r\n",
