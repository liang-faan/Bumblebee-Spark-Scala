The left side of the batik features bunches of lilies, while the right side is decorated with roses. The flower motifs are interspersed with butterflies. The background of the batik is filled with secondary motifs of geometric patterns. A scrolling floral and tendril pattern borders the batik kain panjang.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This batik is structured in the pagi-sore format, comprising two different but related designs on each half of the kain panjang.  The main floral motif on one side consists of bunches of calla lilies while roses embellish the other side.  The entire design is set again a cream ground although the background patterns on each half differ.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.",
