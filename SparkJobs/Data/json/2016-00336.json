It is rectangular in shape. Along its breath, there are alternating patterns of elephants and birds. Along its length, there are also elephants and birds, but in a different form of design and arrangement. Within the borders, the figure of the Hindu deity Shiva is present all over the brocade stole. The pattern of Shiva is upside down from the top of the stole to its horizontal mid-point. He is in a lotus position and there are patterns of tree branches that come with flowers and parakeets.", "sgcool_label_text" : "This Benarasi silk brocade carries the extremely unusual motif of Shiva as Yogeshwara, seated as an ascetic upon a tiger skin, holding a trident in one hand, damroo in the other, which a cobra around his shoulders. Each figure is separated by a flowering plant upon which are perched a magpie and a woodpecker. It is a superb example of the fine detail that Benarasi weavers could achieve using multi-coloured threads and a very tight weave.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Brocade Stole", "creation_date" : "1801 - 2000", "subject_terms_1" : "textiles (visual works) Hinduism allover patterns plant-derived motifs birds (motifs) deities floral patterns motifs", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Indian (South Asian)", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00336", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh, India)", "subject_terms_2" : "Textiles Stoles (Clothing) Shawls Siva (Hindu deity) Motifs", "techniques_name" : "sewing (needleworking technique) weaving"}
