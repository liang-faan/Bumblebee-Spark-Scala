  "sgcool_label_text": "These photographs were taken by Egbert Sheaf, the Australian Trade Commissioner in Singapore, several taken before and some of which were most likely taken when he was posted here between 1922-25. Sheaf conscientiously studied South-East Asia's ethnography and his scholarship was coupled with a passion for travel and adventure. His photographs cover various aspects of daily and cultural life such as weaving, the rice agriculture and other rituals of Javanese and Malayan communities, as explained and illustrated in the portfolios and albums.",
