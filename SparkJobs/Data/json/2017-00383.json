She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother\n and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds\n rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe\n America and Japan\n especially in the 1980s.  This piece is signed “Liem Siok Hien Kudus”.\n",
