Their father, Au Chu Kin was an herbalist who started Eng Aun Tong (the Hall of Everlasting Peace) and passed the product formula to his sons in the early 1900s.  The Aw brothers perfected the formula in oil and balm form.  The oil form was the original form and was popular in Singapore households from the 1930s onwards.\r\nThe photograph depicts three visitors to the Tiger Balm gardens (also known as the Haw Par Villa).
