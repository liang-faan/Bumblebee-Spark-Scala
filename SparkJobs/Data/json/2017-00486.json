The base of the sculpture is that of a whale. Its tail and its left flipper can be seen. The whale is sculpted in a curved shape, with its mouth and tail curling upwards. Attached to its blowhole is a sculpture of a fountain. It has an oval basin and five tiers, and water can be seen to be released at the top", "sgcool_label_text" : "Especially commissioned by SAM for the Exhibition Imaginarium: Over the Ocean, Under the Sea, Bryde’s Fountain is an adaptation of Krit Ngamsom’s earlier work R. Mutt’s Fountain from his widely praised series of works from his solo exhibition Already Mades (2011). The working fountain, now placed above a stainless steel representation of a Bryde’s whale, playfully evokes a whale’s blowhole. The whale, also known as the Buddha’s whale, resides in the Gulf of Thailand and is an auspicious sight. In presenting the work to audiences, he hopes that good fortunes will smile down upon them.", "preference" : "main", "creator_1" : "Not indicated", "edition_description" : "1 of 3", "title_text" : "Bryde’s Fountain (After Marcel Duchamp)", "creation_date" : "2016", "subject_terms_1" : "sculpture (visual works) whales fountains adaptations (derivative objects)", "creator_role" : "sculptors", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Contemporary (style of art)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00486", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Thailand", "subject_terms_2" : "Kinetic sculpture Installations (Art) Bryde whale Fountains Art Adaptations", "techniques_name" : "forming (physical activity) sculpting"}
