This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966)\n the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular\n exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality\n possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northern coast of Java by the Europeans.  This piece is signed “Nj Oey Kok Sing”.\n",
