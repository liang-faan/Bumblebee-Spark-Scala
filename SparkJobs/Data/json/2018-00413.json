Mounted in gold, this bazuband is set with white sapphires and enamelled on the reverse with polychrome floral designs. \r\n\r\nThe gems are set on a blue ground in the kundan technique. The kundan-set is one of the oldest forms of jewel-making in India and involves layering narrow strips of gold (kundan) to form a solid wedge around the gemstone. Mughal jewellery was often a unique combination of kundan-set gems and enamelling. Traditional mughal jewellery is still made in this manner today. \r\n", "preference" : "main", "creator_1" : "Not indicated", "title_text" : "Bazuband (armband)", "creation_date" : "19th century", "subject_terms_1" : "goldwork (visual works) jewellery ornaments (object genre) allover patterns foliage (motif) flower (motif)", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Mughal styles", "accession_no_csv" : "2018-00413", "shape" : "tubular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Jaipur (inhabited place)", "subject_terms_2" : "Armbands Gold jewellery Goldwork Motifs", "techniques_name" : "jewellery making enamelling layering"}
