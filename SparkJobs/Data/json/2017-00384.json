To differentiate the kepala (broad vertical panel) from the badan (main design field or ‘body’ of the batik), a border of pink rose blooms separates these two sections.  The background filler motifs also vary with the kepala featuring rice kernel shaped motifs and twirling tendrils on the badan.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.
