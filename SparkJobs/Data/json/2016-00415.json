It is in a shape of a leaf, with embroided floral motifs bordering a depiction of a fruit in the center. The fruit resembles a pineapple or promegranate, and is surrounded by several leaves.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This watch case is embroidered with a mixture of glass seed beads and metallic beads. A pomegranate is beaded in a variety of colours, though when treated in such a way and given a set of spikey leaves, it was more likely to represent a pineapple, which symbolizes windfall in a not too distant future. Metallic beads were favoured for their shimmering quality. In comparison with glass seed beads, metallic beads were generally more expensive and produced in smaller quantities.",
