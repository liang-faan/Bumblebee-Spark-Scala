A fear stemming from confusion and feelings of being lost is the predominant theme of the work – and in this particular nightmare, the artist’s loss of his brother has manifested in his subconscious now as disorientation in an unfamiliar environment. \r\n\r\nAn amorphous figure dominates the drawing, standing in the foreground of a crudely executed landscape featuring an unknown mountain (or is it a pyramid?), and as in the other pieces, waves. The identity of the figure is terrifying, but unknown – and from a psychoanalytic viewpoint can be seen as symbolic of the artist’s fear and dread manifest in an anthropomorphic form. \r\n", "preference" : "main", "edition_description" : "Unique", "title_text" : "Again and Again We Are Somewhere", "creation_date" : "2015", "subject_terms_1" : "amorphous  fear anthropomorphic", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Contemporary (style of art)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00848", "shape" : "Rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Thailand", "subject_terms_2" : "Fear Drawing  Loss (Psychology)  Anthropomorphism in art  Art, Thai  Dreams", "techniques_name" : "drawing (image-making)  sketching"}
