  "sgcool_label_text": "This large, heavy brass censor is placed at the centre of the altar and when in use, would contain incense that would be burnt during special occasions such as Chinese New Year. The form of the censor is highly unusual, with the finial atop shaped by vines and leaves into a strange lion-like figure. The handles are shaped to look like bamboo shoots and leaves.\r\n\r\n This item is donated by the family of prominent Peranakan, Ong Sam Leong (b. 1857, Singapore â€“ d. 7 February 1918, Singapore).
