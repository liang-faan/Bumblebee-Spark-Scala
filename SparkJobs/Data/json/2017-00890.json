  "sgcool_label_text": "This blue coloured mandarin-collar top with woven stripes belonged to a majie, a Cantonese female domestic helper. Majie is derived from a Shun Tak term (ma cheh) which means mother and sister. As this group of women had taken a vow never to marry, the term Majie alludes to their spinsterhood and refers to their work taking care of children. Majies typically wore a samfoo uniform consisting of a white mandarin-collar top and black trousers.",
