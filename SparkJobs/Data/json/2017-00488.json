The art historian Simon Soon penned an essay for the exhibition of the works at Lostgens\n which encapsulates the conceptual framework of the series: “In a sense\n chi too’s present exploration of painterly process casts a critical eye on two dominant tendencies in contemporary Malaysian painting. In both trends\n painting is either regarded as either a self-evident channel for allegory or a transparent expression of emotive gesture. These are approaches to painting that Like Someone In Love as a series is evidently not. In terms of his painting method\n chi too begins by choosing a sheet of bubble wrap as the painting support. The process is methodical and follows a pre-determined set of procedure. It requires him to painstakingly inject a small amount of paint into each bubble air pocket with a syringe. The neatly lined rows and columns of the bubble wrap provides chi too with a compositional grid. Based on this gridded matrix\n he would explore a number of configurations that take us through a rudimentary lesson on colour theory.”\n",
