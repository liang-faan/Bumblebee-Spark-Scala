Lamqua was famous in mid-19th century Guangzhou for his outstanding painting skills\n in particular\n for executing European-style works with a realistic figurative composition. Lamqua owned a popular workshop that produced portraits\n harbour views and paintings of other subjects that appealed to foreign customers. Several of Lamqua’s paintings were even exhibited in the West\n including at the Royal Academy in London in the 1830s and 1840s.\n",
