The artist included several landmarks, among them the first European-style buildings in the settlement and the Chinese Custom House. In the foreground, boats take part in a regatta.  \r\n\r\nAs Shanghai grew in stature as a British and European settlement, paintings like this were important records of the development of the port and the increasing volume of international ships in the harbour.
