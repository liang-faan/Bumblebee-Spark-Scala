Interspersed, are various animals that also appear throughout the cloth. Central to this piece is a medallion consisting of scrolling foliage and animals, and is in itself, surrounded by other birds.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This handkerchief is made from a single silk batik base, with a circular central medallion pattern consisting of plants and birds, surrounded by more birds circling around it. It has three drawn-thread patterns around the border, consisting of both geometrice patterns and animals. Judging by the hole in the centre, this cloth was possibly used as a handkerchief pinched between the fingers, or with a bunch of keys tied to the centre. This piece is particularly rare due to the embroidery technique - the drawn-thread pattern is usually only done once around the border. Thread-drawn embroidery is not unique to Peranakan culture, and was practiced by other ethnic groups in Java and Sumatra in the early 20th century. However, the combination of the embroidery and Chinese motifs make it highly likely that this piece is from the Chinese-Peranakan community.",
