They both have similar motifs. Both feature stylised mythical birds with opened and elaborate wings and feathers, amidst flowering tendrils. A winged animal enclosed within a medallion and bordered by tendrils creates a repeated pattern. The shawl has tassels attached to either end.", "sgcool_label_text" : "Mythical birds with elaborate plumage are shown amidst flowering tendrils on this shawl.  Two diamond shaped medallions emphasise a particular type of winged animal that is enclosed within.  It is surrounded by other types of birds set against a cream background with dotted background patterning.  Tassels are attached on both ends of the cloth.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.", "preference" : "alternate main", "title_text" : "A set of garment - shawl and kain panjang Shawl and Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "1950-1980s", "subject_terms_1" : "shawls Peranakan foliage (motif) birds (motifs) legendary beings", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00410", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Shawls Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people)", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
