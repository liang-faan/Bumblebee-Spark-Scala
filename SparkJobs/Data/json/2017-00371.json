There is a signature at the top-left of the batik sarong.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "Large bunches of orchids are set against dense background patterning on the broad vertical section of the batik (kepala).  On the “body” or main design feature (badan) of the cloth, Lily of the Nile blooms were added to the brown background.  Amusing birds in flight bearing envelopes and single blooms enliven the design.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This piece is signed “Liem Siok Hien Pekl”.",
