  "sgcool_label_text": "This is a half-portrait of Judge Hughes in three-quarter view, and set against a plain background.  It is not clear who Judge Hughes is although his choice of Chinese dress suggests his attempt at asserting his Chinese identity.  Coloured pigments were added directly onto this monochromatic photograph.  It is still mounted in its original frame.  Such portraits were hung in the halls of Peranakan homes to commemorate revered ancestors.  This bust portrait contains a signature of the sitter on the bottom right of the photograph.",
