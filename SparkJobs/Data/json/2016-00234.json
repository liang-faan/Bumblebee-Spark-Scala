The boiler would be used to heat a large quantity of water over a coal fire, or similar type of long-burning fuel. The tea maker would use hot water from the boiler to brew tea. \r\nIt is an interesting artefact from the 20th century, and reflects the rise in popularity in beverages such as tea and coffee among Indians, during the Colonial era, and the paraphernalia that has since become associated with their consumption. This type of water boiler is becoming increasingly rare with the emergence of cheaper fuel, as well as changing methods of brewing tea.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Water Boiler", "creation_date" : "1900 - 1999", "subject_terms_1" : "kitchenware utensils implements (object genre)", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00234", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Kerala (India)", "subject_terms_2" : "Water heaters Kitchen utensils", "techniques_name" : "metalworking"}
