The sarong is sewn along its width and worn by wrapping it around the waist.  The badan or body of the cloth features Chinese and Japanese inspired garden motifs on a cream ground.  Bonsai or cherry blossom plants, garden ceramics that echo the shape of Chinese ceramic wares and bronze vessels, elegantly rendered peacocks and pairs of birds on a flowering tree are depicted.  Japanese inspired batik motifs may have a response to the increased popularity of Japanese artwork in the second half the 19th century.
