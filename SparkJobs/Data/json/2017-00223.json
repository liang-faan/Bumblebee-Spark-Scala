Long and Bénédict Pierre Georges Hochreutiner, respectively assistant and temporary assistant at the Botanic Gardens of Buitenzorg (Bogor), in the Dutch East Indies. The fact that botany officers were involved in the production of this tri-language dictionary underscores the importance that European technocrats placed on learning Malay so that they could operate in the field",
