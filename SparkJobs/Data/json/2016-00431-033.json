Yet to ‘use’ Huang Wei entails Oei becoming a medium himself and ‘channelling’ his creation so that the meta-artist can step through time’s portals and enter a realm where history painting still reigns. Still\n even liminal spaces offer fleeting refuge and the stop-motion video Goliath unfolds to reveal the artist’s hand (Huang Wei\n and/or Oei?) in a continuous cycle of creating-destroying his painting\n time and again. In 2009\n the local art public found – to its surprise – that a Singaporean painter active in the Nanyang period had escaped recognition from history books despite leaving behind 76 notable paintings. It was later revealed that Huang Wei never existed – at least not in real life – but was a fiction created by artist-curator Alan Oei. Oei has an enduring fixation with history painting but is troubled that it possesses pale relevance to art-making in the present day. In Huang Wei\n Oei entwined fiction with fact and created a character who stands as a metaphor for a vital but missing part of Singapore’s art history.\n",
