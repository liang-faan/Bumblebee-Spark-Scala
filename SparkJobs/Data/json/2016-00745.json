From left, they are Friar Andrés de Urdaneta (1498–1568), Miguel López de Legazpi (1502–1572), and Ferdinand Magellan (1480–1521). \r\nMagellan was a Portuguese-born explorer best known for captaining on behalf of the Spanish Crown the first fleet of ships that circumnavigated the world. Lopez de Legazpi and Urdaneta formed the first European settlement in the Philippines on Cebu in 1565. Friar Urdaneta’s documentation of his voyage was the basis for the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade route. Spanish ships sailed this route across the Pacific for around 250 years, carrying luxury goods that created riches for Spain.\r\n\r\n", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "Philippines", "context_1" : "Foundation of the Spanish colony in the Philippines", "context_5" : "1565-04-02", "title_text" : "Foundation of the Spanish colony in the Philippines", "creation_date" : "Second half of 17th century - early 18th century", "subject_terms_1" : "colonization trade routes colonists", "context_4" : "1565-04-02", "context_8" : "colonists", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Spanish Colonial", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00745", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Manila (Philippines)", "subject_terms_2" : "Painting Imperialism Colonists Philippines History 1521 - 1898 Manila galleon.
