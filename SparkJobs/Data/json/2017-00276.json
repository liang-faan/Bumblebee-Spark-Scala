The underglazed blue appeared to have smeared and is therefore less defined than the overglazed green and blue.", "sgcool_label_text" : "The jar is decorated with lions and floral scrolls in the wucai style, which sees elements of the design painted in underglaze blue and combined with patterns executed in overglaze polychrome enamels. Although the term wucai literally means ‘five colours’, it actually denotes the use of a multitude of colours and does not always necessarily mean five. Wucai porcelain emerged during the sixteenth century and grew in popularity from the Jiajing period (1522–1566).", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Jar with lions motif", "creation_date" : "Ming dynasty, 17th century", "subject_terms_1" : "enamels (visual works)  porcelain paintings (visual works)  freehand drawings (drawings)  symbolism", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Chinese ceramics styles  Ming (culture, period, and styles)  Wucai (Chinese ceramics styles)  Polychrome style", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00276", "shape" : "concave", "creation_place_original_location" : "China", "subject_terms_2" : "Floral decorations  Polychrome Lion Mythology  China painting", "techniques_name" : "glazing (coating process)  throwing (pottery techniques)  underglazing molding (forming)  firing (technique)  porcelain painting (image-making) freehand drawing (technique)  overglazing enameling"}
