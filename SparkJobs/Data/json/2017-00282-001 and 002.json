  "sgcool_label_text": "This object is a ceremonial vessel possibly used for holy water.  It is tear-shaped with a small, hammered indentation at the centre. It is thought to be a symbol of the Great Goddess, the yoni (or vulva), and the indentation is thought to indicate the male counterpart, the god Shiva in the form of a linga (phallus). \r\n\r\nThe goddess is the energy of the god, or his shakti. Her presence galvanises him into action. Therefore the combination of the male and female principal brings all things into being. \r\n",
