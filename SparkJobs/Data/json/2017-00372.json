It features two different but similar designs on each half of the batik. The left side of the batik kain panjang is decorated with elegantly rendered peacocks perched on grape vines.

There is a signature at the top-left of the batik kain panjang.", "sgcool_label_text" : "This kain panjang is structured in the pagi-sore format, comprising two different but related designs on each half of the batik.  The design on the two halves centres on the theme of posterity and harmony.  On one side, elegantly rendered peacocks perch on grape vines while cranes and chicks decorate the other half.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This batik is signed “Liem Siok Hien Kudus”.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "1950-1965", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan flower (motif) foliage (motif) birds (motifs) cultural diffusion symbolism", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00372", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs Culture diffusion Symbolism", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
