The image on the right contains a close-up of the painting in question, while the image on the left hand side shows the same painting, with its frames and white border visible. Images of pumpkins, with leaves and thin branches, are depicted in the painting. There are two vertical lines of Chinese characters on the left hand side of the painting.", "sgcool_label_text" : "Pumpkin is an exemplary work by Wu Tsai Yen that demonstrates his skilled execution and mastery of the finger-painting technique, which traces its practice to the Tang Dynasty. At the same time, this particular painting acts as a record of a visit Wu had. Shown in the inscription, on a day during the start of the winter season in 1964, Jiong Xi brought along some refined objects, most likely antiques or curiosities of some sort, during his meeting with Wu. It was an enjoyable time. \r\n\r\nWhile it is not known to us who Jiong Xi might be, the choice of material and motif of this painting emblems the precious moment of friendship and in the changing season. The orange colour of the pumpkin and its swaying leaves gives off a translucent gleamy effect on the paper, which carries specks of white, silver, and gold.", "preference" : "main main", "creator_1" : "Wu, Zaiyan, 1911-2001", "title_text" : "Pumpkin ???", "creation_date" : "1964", "subject_terms_1" : "symbolism (artistic concept) squash (gourd)", "creator_role" : "painters (artist)", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Chinese (culture or style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2018-00406", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore (nation) Malay Peninsula", "subject_terms_2" : "Paintings Symbolism Motifs Squashes", "techniques_name" : "creating (artistic activity) finger painting (technique)", "scale_type" : "Not indicated"}
