Covered with a black silk fabric, it is adorned with a single black grosgrain ribbon. The mark of its maker is vaguely visible. A red box seemingly custom made to hold the hat accompanies it. A shopmark can be made out on the underside, including the word ‘England’. \r\n\r\nThe Gibus hat was named after the man who patented it in 1837, Antoine Gibus. It was held under the arm and paired with an opera clock. Top hats were staple to an European gentleman’s wardrobe for much of the 19th century.
