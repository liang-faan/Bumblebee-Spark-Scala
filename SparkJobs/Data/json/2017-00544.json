  "sgcool_label_text": "This piece is a sarong kecil, or a child’s tube-like skirt. Meant for a child’s body, it is significantly smaller than a normal sarong. The kepala (head) consists of multicoloured diagonal bands of blue, green, cream, and red, with a pattern of birds and flowering plants running through them. In the badan (body) section contains a large pattern of a lotus plant and birds.  When toddlers in a Peranakan household grew old enough, the girls would generally start wearing small sarongs, whereas the boys would move towards pantsuits. Sarong kecil are quite rare as most people did not want to devote such resources to clothing which would be quickly outgrown.",
