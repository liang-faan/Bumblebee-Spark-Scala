  "sgcool_label_text": "This kain panjang features motifs commonly seen on Cirebon batik designs.  Set against a black background, the Cirebon cloud motif (megamendung), is depicted in trios with attached plant forms, and as a rocky landscape surrounded by birds.  A flame-like motif is also shown above the rock formations, and on the pink wavy border near the bottom of the cloth.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This piece is signed “Hendromartono’s © Batik Art “Unique” Pekalongan Java Indonesia”.",
