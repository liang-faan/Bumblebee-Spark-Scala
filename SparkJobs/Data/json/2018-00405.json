While one reading suggests that this friend may be Tan’s elder sister\n it is quite common during that time to address someone who is familiar to you as a sibling. Based on the inscription\n we know that this friend is named Pei Ying\n while her son is named Rui Qing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe content of the painting suggests that it was a gift for Rui Qing’s wedding\n as the fruit pomegranate is often used in Chinese ink paintings as a blessed symbol of having many children. This reason lies in the homophonic relation between the Chinese character for children or particularly refers to sons and seeds. Pomegranate is a fruit that has numerous seeds\n and hence\n became an auspicious symbol ‘to bear many children/sons’.\n",
