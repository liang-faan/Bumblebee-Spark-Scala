The design features elongated triangles at both ends of the kain panjang, against a dark background with rosette patterns. The middle section of the kain panjang is decorated with repeated floral bouquets against a cream background. There are no signatures on this kain panjang.", "sgcool_label_text" : "The design structure of this kain panjang is typical of north coast batik from the same period, in particular the split kepalas (or elongated triangles) on both ends of the batik.  Bouquets of flowers embellish the main design field (badan) of the cloth, creating a wallpaper effect.  They are reminiscent of the “wallpaper” patterns that are stamped on wallpaper with the wooden blocks.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Soen King (1861-1942), the first in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her batiks feature the classic layout typical of her time, and are embellished with Chinese traditional motifs.  These motifs include lotus flowers, centipedes and cloud motifs, which are rendered sensitively and imaginatively.  The combination of natural red and blue dyes on a cream ground is also characteristic of batiks made during this period in the north coast of Java, before the invention and widespread popularity of chemical dyes in batik sarongs by the late 19th century.  Oey Soen King’s pieces were all unsigned as signatures were not yet fashionable.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "Late 19th-early 20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan flower (motif) birds (motifs) foliage (motif)", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00334", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
