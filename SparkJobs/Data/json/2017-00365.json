She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother\n and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds\n rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe\n America and Japan\n especially in the 1980s.  This kain panjang is signed “Batik Kesenian Liem Siok Hien Kudus”.  Kudus was added to indicate that her design was executed in the Kudus style although she lived and worked in Pekalongan.\n",
