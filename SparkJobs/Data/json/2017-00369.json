The sawat was reserved for the Javanese courts’ exclusive use in the past.  On this kain panjang, the artist, Jane Hendromartono embeds the sawat alongside faces composed of tendrils, providing a surprising twist to the overall design.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.  This batik is signed “100% Tulis Hendromartono’s Batik Art” Unique Pekalongan”.", "preference" : "main", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "creation_date" : "1965-1980s", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan flower (motif) foliage (motif) cultural diffusion", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00369", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs Culture diffusion", "techniques_name" : "batik"}
