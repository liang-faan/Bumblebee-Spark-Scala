Nature inspired jewellery, featuring flora and fauna were common in South India. The m?nga m?lai design can be traced as far back as the Chola period, as seen in bronzes produced at the time. This pair of necklaces are important in many ways â€“ they bear testimony to the socio-cultural heritage of Tamils in Singapore; they are also superior examples of Indian gold craftsmanship and of the material culture of Tamils in the region in the 19th\/20th centuries.", "preference" : "main alternate main", "title_text" : "South Indian Necklaces A Pair of South Indian Necklaces m?nikka addigai and m?nga m?lai", "creation_date" : "1801 - 1939", "subject_terms_1" : "jewellery craftsmanship neck ornaments costume accessories floral patterns goldwork (visual works) neck ornaments", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Indian (South Asian)", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00363", "shape" : "U-shaped round (shape)", "creation_place_original_location" : "India, South", "subject_terms_2" : "Ethnic jewellery Gold jewellery Workmanship Dress accessories Necklaces Goldwork", "techniques_name" : "metalworking jewellery making"}
