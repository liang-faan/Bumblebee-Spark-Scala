He was involved in filmmaking in the film community of Nanjing.  \\r\\nHe was one of the founding members of the Penang Chinese Art Club (or Yin Yin Art Society) in 1935\n along with Kuo Ju Ping as well as Yong Mun Sen. At the onset of the 2nd Sino-Japanese war in 1937\n he returned to Perak and was persuaded to teach art by Kuo in Penang. He relocated to Singapore\n becoming an early teacher of Western Art at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in 1940\n where he also took up the appointment of Head of Guidance Counselling. He left after a year and later set up the Hai Xia Art Supplies Company (Straits Commercial Art Co.) with former NAFA alumnus Tay Long that provided advertising signages as well as sold paintings alongside supplies in its early years.
