  "sgcool_label_text": "Prof. Chong Pai Mu  (b. 1911 – date of death not confirmed) (sometimes Zhong Baimu or Chung Pak Mook) is regarded as one of the early artists and educators in Western art in Penang and Singapore. He studied at the Xinhua Art Academy, Shanghai, later at the Nanjing Central University, under Xu Beihong as well as at the Beiping Central Academy. He was involved in filmmaking in the film community of Nanjing.  \r\nHe was one of the founding members of the Penang Chinese Art Club (or Yin Yin Art Society) in 1935, along with Kuo Ju Ping as well as Yong Mun Sen. At the onset of the 2nd Sino-Japanese war in 1937, he returned to Perak and was persuaded to teach art by Kuo in Penang. He relocated to Singapore, becoming an early teacher of Western Art at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in 1940, where he also took up the appointment of Head of Guidance Counselling. He left after a year and later set up the Hai Xia Art Supplies Company (Straits Commercial Art Co.) with former NAFA alumnus Tay Long that provided advertising signages as well as sold paintings alongside supplies in its early years. The partnership ended a few years later and Chong left Singapore. His practice is sometimes framed with Chen Jen Hao, Huang Baofang and Tchang Ju Chi. He eventually resettled in Hong Kong.  \r\n\r\nThe art work features a young girl in pig-tails, her tanned complexion a stark contrast to her light pastel-hued ribbons and dress. A 1996 auction in Taipei had in fact titled the work a Portrait of a Malay Girl in light of her complexion. (Ref: Fine Modern Chinese Oil Paintings, Drawings & Watercolours Auction, Taipei, 14 April 1996, Lot 58).  The work is signed and dated 1945 on the left lower of the canvas - executed when the artist was in his mid-30s, a few years after he had left the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts as lecturer of Western Art.\r\n \r\n",
