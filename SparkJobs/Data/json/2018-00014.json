These forlorn fragments document the interior and surroundings of the titular mansion\n located in Ipoh.

Today\n it lies in a state of suggestive ruin\n the Foo family having left most of their belongings behind\n including furniture\n antiques and personal letters. The artist remarks: “Imagine these sequences as photographs that teeter on the cusp of becoming the moving image; stills that\n at certain points\n suddenly flow into a depiction of a whole series of events: small actions that\n seen collectively\n build up into a narrative – a film\n even\n of sorts.”\n",
