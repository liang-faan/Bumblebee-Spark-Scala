Central to the tunic is a large red lotus motif surrounded by phoenixes and peonies. It is paired with a skirt which has a frontal and back panel joined together at the waist; each panel has either a dragon or a phoenix motif that is framed by floral borders.",
  "sgcool_label_text": "This skirt is made up of two pieces, a frontal panel and a back panel joined together at the waist.  Each panel comprises either an auspicious dragon or phoenix motif.  Framed by brightly coloured floral borders, the dragon and phoenix are worked in gold thread couchings.  The front-facing coiled dragon motif was possibly inspired by Ming dynasty imperial court robes, with the dragon symbolising the emperorâ€™s centrality in the universe.  Dragons are seldom seen in Peranakan embroidery, whereas the phoenix, signifying loyalty and good fortune, is more common.  Here, the dragon represents the yang or male principle while the phoenix represents the complementary yin or female principle. The bride wore this skirt together with a tunic as part of her twelve-day Peranakan wedding.",
