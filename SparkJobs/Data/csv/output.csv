Wedding necklaces such as this were worn by Peranakan Chinese brides throughout the Straits Settlements and the Dutch East Indies. The ornateness of this example appears to have originated from Jakarta (Batavia), although the exceptional quality of the necklace makes a precise geographical assignment difficult. Brides were draped with several necklaces to form an impressive assemblage and other jewelled ornamentation as a sign of the wealth and splendour of the occasion. Such necklaces became prized family heirlooms and were passed down the generations."

Artist Statement: 
In this series, webcam was used to do live recording of families in Singapore. The recording was then transmitted via skype to countries where the main sitters are located and projected onto their living space. This is how families, dis(membered) through time and space, can be re(membered) and made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.

Drawing upon my own experiences of being separated from my family as a New York-based Singaporean, this work documents and examines our condition of new-wave diaspora – Singaporean families of various races and ethnicities grappling with the same predicament of separation through time and space.

I also want this project to document and interpret a contemporary social-historical blueprint as it happens, allowing the future generations to reflect on it.

In addition, this is also an extension of one of the recurring theme of my works: the fascination with the expressions of time and space and how we negotiate our human existences within these two dimensions. this work specifically addresses the phenomenon of differing time zones, the different dimensions of our human representations, and how we can finally coexist, albeit in pixilated and two-dimensional forms.

Artist Statement: 
In this series, webcam was used to do live recording of families in Singapore. The recording was then transmitted via skype to countries where the main sitters are located and projected onto their living space. This is how families, dis(membered) through time and space, can be re(membered) and made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.

Drawing upon my own experiences of being separated from my family as a New York-based Singaporean, this work documents and examines our condition of new-wave diaspora – Singaporean families of various races and ethnicities grappling with the same predicament of separation through time and space.

I also want this project to document and interpret a contemporary social-historical blueprint as it happens, allowing the future generations to reflect on it.

In addition, this is also an extension of one of the recurring theme of my works: the fascination with the expressions of time and space and how we negotiate our human existences within these two dimensions. this work specifically addresses the phenomenon of differing time zones, the different dimensions of our human representations, and how we can finally coexist, albeit in pixilated and two-dimensional forms.

Erasure revolves around my aged parents and parents-in-law in their seventies and their photographs taken during a family trip to Tokyo several years ago. The series title refers to my painstaking act of fading their images from the photographs with an ink eraser as a graphic portrayal of how life quietly empties itself from them. The resulting faint images becomes an urgent testimony of their slowly fading existence from this world, as well as from my life. Ironically, they are resurrected in my emotional space as reawakened memories by the very act of erasure - at once emotionally torment and intimate. Despite the joyous association of a holiday destination, this work speaks of my own uneasy anticipation of their final destination - death.

This dread extends even to the contemplation of my own death. Their fast aging faces become a reflection and questioning of my own mortality - a question I first asked myself many years ago as a child of four: what will happen to me when my parents die? This thought haunts me till this day.

by John Clang (b. 1973) 

Artist Statement: 
In this series, webcam was used to do live recording of families in Singapore. The recording was then transmitted via skype to countries where the main sitters are located and projected onto their living space. This is how families, dis(membered) through time and space, can be re(membered) and made whole again through the use of a third space, a site that is able to reassemble them together within the photographic space that we call a family portrait.

Drawing upon my own experiences of being separated from my family as a New York-based Singaporean, this work documents and examines our condition of new-wave diaspora – Singaporean families of various races and ethnicities grappling with the same predicament of separation through time and space.

I also want this project to document and interpret a contemporary social-historical blueprint as it happens, allowing the future generations to reflect on it.

In addition, this is also an extension of one of the recurring theme of my works: the fascination with the expressions of time and space and how we negotiate our human existences within these two dimensions. this work specifically addresses the phenomenon of differing time zones, the different dimensions of our human representations, and how we can finally coexist, albeit in pixilated and two-dimensional forms.

About the artist-photographer:
John Clang is a photographer and visual artist. His fascination on time, displacement and existentialism influence his work. He held his first exhibition at 20 years old and has since participated in more than 20 solo & group exhibitions in China, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States. In 2010, he became the first photographer in Singapore to receive the President's Designer of the Year award, which is the most prestigious design accolade in Singapore.

Erasure revolves around my aged parents and parents-in-law in their seventies and their photographs taken during a family trip to Tokyo several years ago. The series title refers to my painstaking act of fading their images from the photographs with an ink eraser as a graphic portrayal of how life quietly empties itself from them. The resulting faint images becomes an urgent testimony of their slowly fading existence from this world, as well as from my life. Ironically, they are resurrected in my emotional space as reawakened memories by the very act of erasure - at once emotionally torment and intimate. Despite the joyous association of a holiday destination, this work speaks of my own uneasy anticipation of their final destination - death.

This dread extends even to the contemplation of my own death. Their fast aging faces become a reflection and questioning of my own mortality - a question I first asked myself many years ago as a child of four: what will happen to me when my parents die? This thought haunts me till this day.

The collection consists of several sets of gaming pieces and dice. The games of chaupar and pacheesi can be traced back to ancient times, through archaeological and literary evidences. Although the gaming ‘board’ (traditionally cloth stitched into a ‘cross’ shape, with square segments where each player’s pawns would be placed and would move over) has seen changes, the pawns and dice have remained almost consistent through the centuries. The pawns in this collection are shaped as elongated domes, or squat columns, are fluted or turned, and stained with pigment in many pieces. The dice are of the typical Indian fashion, called pasa – oblong and four-sided.
Both games have been played in various ways across the Indian subcontinent, and can be dated back to at least the Vedic period. Chaupar was considered a suitable game for royalty, and was an extremely popular pastime under the Mughal Emperor Akbar. During the British period, the games were popularised in the west and are still known as ‘parcheesi’. The popularity of the games across class divides led to the creation of gaming pieces and dice that ranged from the simple turned and painted wood, to elaborate ivory and silver, as represented in this collection, and even gemstones, enamel (meena) and gold."

It dates to the end of the nineteenth century and possibly a little later and seems to be an exceptionally rare wall hanging, either for a particularly wealthy family perhaps to be hung in a grand mansion, or perhaps to be used in conjunction with a Parsi theatre troupe, possibly as a back drop. 
It comprises gold thread embroidery and spangle applique work over thick purple velvet. Such work is known as jari work, which was centred on Surat, and is similar to the thick embroidery work in gold and silver thread on velvet known as zardozi work undertaken for the Mughal and Lucknow courts to decorate wall hangings, shoes, jackets and even umbrellas. Jari work is more typically seen on smaller articles for wear such as the caps and jackets commissioned for initiation (navjote) rituals.
Parsi theatre troupes were enormously popular and influential in the wider community in northern India, and the renewed interest in Persopolis and ancient history was reflected in the stage shows that the troupes staged. Realistically painted, magnificent palace interiors, mountainous landscapes, magnificent palace interiors or townscapes with streets and buildings were themes for backdrops commissioned. Generous amounts of money were spent commissioning these for use in plays. It is possible that the wall hanging here was produced for just this purpose. Singapore too has a history of Parsi theatre."

The double-baluster stem supports five candleholders shaped like lotuses. Candelabra were made for dining tables in Europe and America. However, much of the design and decoration of this object is distinctly Chinese.

The form of this candelabra was made in copper, which was then coated with pigments containing ground glass. The object was then fired to create a bright glassy coating. In the 18th century, this type was production for foreign export in Guangzhou (Canton), with the result that the type is often called Canton enamel."

Radha, whose name means ‘prosperity’, was chief among the milkmaids (gopis). She was the favourite consort of the young cowherd Krishna. She is often depicted standing next to him and together they represent love, passion, and devotion. Primarily Hindu deities they were also worshipped by Jains."

A great variety of vessels are present in the harbour, including a coastal junk, Tanka boats operated by blue-robed “Boat Dwellers” (native ethnic minorities of Southern China), covered hulks (obsolete sailing ships converted for use as naval base), small side wheelers, and three-masted sailing ships flying the flags of Britain, France and the United States.   The first views of Hong Kong, such as this example, began to appear in the early 19th century. The British built their first city on the island of Hong Kong and called it Victoria city (presently Sheung Wan and Sai Wan districts). The name “Victoria” demonstrated the extent of rule and authority of the British government. As Hong Kong grew in stature as a British crown colony, such paintings became an important record of the development of the port and the increasing volume of international ships that called to port. Beyond the great number of vessels that visited the important Hong Kong harbour, lies a curiosity in the presence of a junk-rigged vessel with additional jib and topsails in Western fashion. The adapted design of the ship illustrates the pluralistic nature of interactions within cosmopolitan harbours. The port was a gate way of cross-cultural interaction between the East and the West, and demonstrates artistic and cultural exchange between China and the world. Such paintings were known as China trade paintings, and were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Produced largely for visiting tourists and foreign traders, the paintings were executed by local and foreign artists, working in a Western style in order to appeal to the market. Art studios were set up in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, where mass-produced genre scenes of treaty ports, portraits and still lifes were sold as souvenirs. While China trade paintings found a huge market at that time, the growing popularity of photography in the late 19th century shifted this demand pattern, eventually rendering such trade paintings obsolete."

The realistic portrayal of the Chinese merchant is the result of the artist’s deft application of the Western painting technique of chiaroscuro---the use of light and shading to create a sense of three-dimensionality.  Lamqua was famous in mid-19th century Guangzhou for his outstanding painting skills, in particular, for executing European-style works with a realistic figurative composition. Lamqua owned a popular workshop that produced portraits, harbour views and paintings of other subjects that appealed to foreign customers. Several of Lamqua’s paintings were even exhibited in the West, including at the Royal Academy in London in the 1830s and 1840s."

The art of painting in enamels on copper was introduced from Europe into China during the late Kangxi period (1622-1722), probably by Jesuit missionaries, and came into vogue in the 18th century. The bustling city of Guangzhou, where this inkwell was likely made, was an important production centre of enamelled metalwares for both the domestic and export markets during the Qing dynasty (1644–1911)."

Contributing to their impressive realism, both figures are carved and painted in refined wood and embellished with real human hair, glass eyes and clothes made from pineapple leaf fibres. The shoulders, elbows, hips and knees of both figures are separately attached, giving the figures a mobility that enhances their life-like quality. Two custom made gilt wood chairs allow for the figures to be displayed seated or standing. All materials are original and made exclusively in Manila.  The dressing of the couple exemplifies the style and fashion of the Manila wealthy class during the first half of the 19th century. The gold jewellery was specifically made for the figures as evident by the smallness of their size. Two crucifixes in gold adorn both figures. The female figure wears gold hoop earrings and a gold and tortoiseshell Pieneta (comb) in her hair. The jewels executed in precious and expensive materials, display excellent craftsmanship and reflect the elite status of its owners.  The male figure wears a beige delicately embroidered Baro (formal blouse) and pants of a colourful ikkat dyed textile, which is typical of Manila. European influence is evident by the gentleman's top hat and shape of trousers. Stylistic adaptations were made as seen by how the Baro is worn over the trousers, in consideration of the tropical heat. The female figure wears a similar beige embroidered Baro which is shorter in length and ends at the waist. She has over her shoulders an Alampay (shawl), a Saya (long skirt) and a Tapis (short overskirt wrapped around the Saya). Intricately sewn shoes complete the outfit. Crucifix pendants on both figures make a clear reference to the close relationship between Filipino Mestizos and the Catholic Church's missionary work in the Philippines, which dates back to the 17th century. This close affiliation was a result of the alleviated social standing Mestizos enjoyed under the colonial caste system. This led to the involvement of Mestizos in the subsequent translation of Sacred Scriptures for the Sangleys (Chinese people in the Philippines). For this reason, there are some royal decrees (since the early years of Spanish colonisation) which promoted foundations to accommodate orphan Mestizos, assisting and educating them for their future integration into society. \"The remarkable quality of carving, polychrome work and the value of the original textiles and accessories, suggests that these \"\"dolls\"\" were never intended as a child's toy; but as faithful witnesses of their time.\""

Their father, Au Chu Kin was an herbalist who started Eng Aun Tong (the Hall of Everlasting Peace) and passed the product formula to his sons in the early 1900s.  The Aw brothers perfected the formula in oil and balm form.  The oil form was the original form and was popular in Singapore households from the 1930s onwards.
The photograph depicts three visitors to the Tiger Balm gardens (also known as the Haw Par Villa). This villa garden was an entertainment park to teach and preserve traditional Chinese values (such as filial piety) through the exposition of folklore, legends and historical events in the form of tableaux and figurines."

Talismanic shirts are considered to be related to large paper and parchment talismanic charts, that is, they can be viewed more as manuscripts than wearable garments. The use of these shirts are not always well defined, although it is commonly understood that such shirts are worn by warriors underneath their armour to protect them during battles. However, it has also been suggested that these shirts could be worn for other objectives such as healing garments, much like how large talismanic charts have been used to cover the body of a sick person like a blanket."

Each side is made of particularly fine, solid silver filigree. One of the triangular sides is hinged and opens, permitting access to the interior. The form fits into the oeuvre of scientific and mathematical devices in the Islamic world, perhaps tempered with mysticism and notions of magic. It is also known in gaming and has been used as a rare type of dice based on the Platonic solid known as an icosahedron consisting of 20 equilateral triangle faces that meet five to a corner. Each side of such a dice is numbered from one to twenty. With so many faces, such a dice is easy to roll, being almost spherical. Such dice appear to be more prevalent in the Islamic world, and generally are shaped from solid stone. This example might have been made in India, but the filigree is more in keeping with filigree that is associated with 18th century Batavia or the West Coast of  Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies.  It is possible, perhaps likely, that it was made there for export for the Islamic market in India, perhaps as a diplomatic gift. It also has a small Dutch import mark for foreign silver which bolsters the case that it was made in the Dutch East Indies, and perhaps was never sent to India. Most probably it was made in the Dutch East Indies at the behest of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for the India market."

Embodying the fusion of the Western form with Indian material and technique, Indo-European furniture were an important derivative of the spice trade that the European Companies were engaged in South (India and Ceylon) and Southeast Asia (Batavia). 
The Coromandel Coast, a region of early textile production, lined with international ports, received traders from the East and the West, and emerged as an early centre of production of Western-style furniture. For instance, the craftsmanship of these artisans suggests their exposure to Western examples and Western-style Asian creations; a familiarity which grew with the establishment of the European powers in India.  Other centres of European trade and settlement such as the Malabar and Gujarat Coasts and Bengal also became centres of production; while trading centres such as Goa, Surat and Cambay also functioned as sourcing points for readymade furniture. 

This is a very fine example of a miniature chess set and table from the Vizag region. The octagonal top with sandalwood is overlaid with ivory, with a central chess board created ivory and horn insets. The ivory embellishment around the table top has four medallion disks engraved with Hindu deities, the feet of the table embellished with zoomorphic ivory feet.

Despite being an avowed Buddhist, Thawan has invoked the importance Hinduism has within Thai folk culture with his depiction of Hanuman, a central figure of the Ramayanan or Ramakien (in Thai). Popularly known as the Monkey God, Hanuman is in Hindu accounts, the incarnation or avatar of Shiva and represents divine strength, power and agility. Here in this painting, Thawan captures a chapter in the chronicles of Hanuman in which the monkey deity is ravenous with hunger and mistakes the sun for a ripened mango. As he chases the sun, the god Indra intervenes by striking Hanuman in the jaw, triggering a saga of retaliation from Hanuman’s father.
Hanuman was part of a renowned series of 14 paintings shown at his solo exhibition at the British Council in Bangkok in 1973. This work comes from a period just after Thawan’s paintings were slashed by students in 1971 for supposedly desecrating Buddhism as he had juxtaposed erotic, monstrous forms with the Buddha, and he was at the time residing at the Student Christian Centre which led to a misconception that Thawan was a sacrilegious Christian railing against Buddhist beliefs. The Ramayana series however did not cause the same controversy of his earlier works because the depicted subjects were monkeys and demons rather than Buddhism."

Bowrey (ca. 1650-1713), was an East India Company (EIC) sea captain who spent nineteen years from 1669 sailing about the islands, seas and coastlines of the Malay Archipelago. He endured many perils during his voyages, including attacks by pirates, hidden shipwrecks and local warfare. Bowrey explains in the Preface (p. 6) the reasons for such a publication: ‘I finding so very few English Men that have attained any tollerable knowledge of the Malayo tongue, so absolutely necessary to trade in those Southern Seas, and that there is no book of this kind published in English, to help the attaining of that Language; these considerations, I say, has imboldened me to publish the insuing Dictionary…”. That such a dictionary existed so early in the 18th century, suggests that international trade in the area was significant enough for the English to learn the language of business there, i.e. Malay."

As a mentee of Peter Harris, Ng was one of the earliest members of the Wednesday Art Group, founded in 1952 and was secretary to the group who met at the Selangor Education Department office. Ng left for London under a British Council-administered scholarship known as the Sino-British fellow trust, now defunct, to study at the Hammersmith College of Art and Building (later Chelsea College of Art) from 1964-66. He continued his studies at Southlands Teacher Training College (majoring in fine art and textiles) from 1966-68. In his work, Ng incorporates a range of local Malaysian iconography and his distinctive style has positioned him as one of the most highly acclaimed artists in the history of modern Malaysian art.  

Upon comparing his painting styles across other works, this proposed work was likely to have been painted around the time of Ng’s most well-known painting Spirit of earth, water and air (1958/59), which is gazetted in the Malaysian National Heritage Register List and listed by Redza Piyadasa as one of the masterpieces in the collection of the National Art Gallery Malaysia. Spirit was used as front cover image for SAM’s catalogue Modernity and Beyond (1996). Ng’s Self-Portrait from 1958 is also rendered with similar motifs and in a similar colour scheme.  The proposed painting also looks to be a probable precursor to both those paintings, where Ng is working out the landscape composition and patterns from natural elements before the inclusion of human figures."

Boxes are unusual among extant examples of Zhangzhou wares, making this pair an important addition to the museum’s collection of Zhangzhou ceramics."

Expansive in scope and in spirit, Bloodline of Peace brings together a diverse range of Singaporeans who are conjoined through the shared act of giving life’s most precious fluid: blood. Unfolding like a monumental quilt, the work comprises over 11,500 units created from more than 34,500 prismatic Fresnel lenses, a material that Victor first used in 1997. Now, in Bloodline of Peace, each segment holds and magnifies in its ‘heart’ a single drop of blood contributed by individuals representing Singapore’s key communities such as the armed forces, medicine, civil defence, the arts, and the pioneer generation.

Blood is life, and when drawn by force, it implies brutality, pain, and death. Yet, when donated voluntarily, it is an act that saves the lives of loved ones – and strangers – during medical emergencies. Ultimately, the symbolically rich gift of blood signifies the utmost sacrifice for a fellow human being and for nation, and poignantly, peace – that most fragile of conditions – can oftentimes only be attained, upheld and protected through a willingness to make this highest sacrifice. In the artist’s words: “A transient state, ‘Peace’ is defined by absence – that of war and bloodshed. To be sustainable, commitment and preservation are  necessary processes undertaken by civilians while armed and medical personnel are at the frontiers”."

(His name is rendered entirely in small letters.) He is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice “vacillates between the high-minded and the frivolous, the social and the personal, the transparent and the esoteric”, in the artist’s own words. He was also a member of the disbanded art collective The Best Art Show in the Universe. Since then, he has participated in various exhibitions and performance events in Malaysia and abroad, and was a Nippon Foundation Asian Public Intellectual (API) fellow in 2011. He has held four solo exhibitions to date, Longing (2011) at Blackbox MAP, Publika, Malaysia; State of Doubt (2012) at Akiba Art Lab, Tokyo Japan; and The Artist chi too Looks at Artworks As He Contemplates The State of the Nation’s Institutions a.k.a. How Can You Be Sure (2013) at Art Row, Publika, Malaysia, and most recently at the independent art space, Lostgens, at which he showed the Like Someone in Love series, of which the present work is a part.  Like Someone in Love #10 is a triptych of bubble-wrap paintings – sheets of that ubiquitous packing material, the individual bubbles of which have been painstakingly filled with acrylic paint via a syringe. The art historian Simon Soon penned an essay for the exhibition of the works at Lostgens, which encapsulates the conceptual framework of the series: “In a sense, chi too’s present exploration of painterly process casts a critical eye on two dominant tendencies in contemporary Malaysian painting. In both trends, painting is either regarded as either a self-evident channel for allegory or a transparent expression of emotive gesture. These are approaches to painting that Like Someone In Love as a series is evidently not. In terms of his painting method, chi too begins by choosing a sheet of bubble wrap as the painting support. The process is methodical and follows a pre-determined set of procedure. It requires him to painstakingly inject a small amount of paint into each bubble air pocket with a syringe. The neatly lined rows and columns of the bubble wrap provides chi too with a compositional grid. Based on this gridded matrix, he would explore a number of configurations that take us through a rudimentary lesson on colour theory.”"

He has also participated in numerous group exhibitions both within and outside his home country. His work, Unreadable Wall, is, quite literally, a wall of Babel. Comprised of some 1,760 bricks made out of shredded and pulped newspaper sheets, it represents a lamentation on the state of disunity in his home country – an emerging economy that enjoys limited press freedom, and has seen itself mired in communal, race-based politics that was the result of the New Economic Policy, and which gave rise to a new generation of Malaysians who remain divided along ethnic, linguistic and religious lines. According to the artist, \"\"Where the real story is never told to the masses and in order for them to gain access to the issues at hand they need more than access to the press.This traces back to a more deep-rooted issue of a less than satisfactory education system which stifles and undermines them and prevents them from making a change to the system and the powers that be.

As history would have it, Germany’s nuclear programme was never fully realized. America, on the other hand, went on to develop the atomic bomb, which was deployed with devastating consequences during the Second World War, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Decades later, the nuclear accident in Fukushima reminded the world of the perils of nuclear power, even as it left yet another scar on the psyche of the Japanese people. At first glance a visually seductive and scintillating work, Vortex 2015 reveals its dark heart, for its core is formed in the shape of a nuclear reactor. The message contained within its pieces of glass can only be read as shadows cast on the floor and surrounding walls – a comment perhaps, on how seduced we are by the promise of nuclear power that we choose to disregard or turn away from direct confrontation with its dangers. The choice of glass as a medium for this work has an additional layer of significance, beyond its immediate formal associations with the reflective crystalline components of chandeliers, for glass is also a medium to deactivate nuclear waste. A companion piece installed on the surrounding walls, The Dead Line, spells out in barely visible text, the names and dates of other nuclear disasters throughout history. These are incidents that many have chosen not to remember, but they are irrevocably etched into our shared history and psyche – warnings that we choose to ignore at our own peril."

The experience of growing up a Chinese woman in a social polity that privileges male, Malay-Muslim identity is foregrounded in Kuik’s work, where photography, for one, serves as the medium for her to explore social distances and attachments for its documentary and narrative quality. With the two Jangan Tipu (“Don’t Lie”) drawings, the artist notes that: “In analog photography, the negative is a latent image that unfolds the image/reality to the future – a prophetic object embedded with an oracle/truth. From the photographs taken by myself during the previous Bersih rallies 2.0 and 3.0 in 2011 and 2012, I have chosen 2 images, each with a dominant feminine figure at the center of the composition, looking out quietly yet in confidence at the audience. By using the concept of Madonna depicted in the classical Western painting, I would like to emphasize the role of females and their participation in the public and political sphere. With the help of grids, I measured each persons and objects in the composition by endless back and forth verifications, with the hope to anchor my subject matter to the space of action– the street, where the Bersih rallies took place. Spending day and night on the drawing has thus become a ritual for me to linger longer at the moment where the image was being taken, to become aware of the making of history. In Jangan Tipu 1, Teoh Lee Lan, the sister of Teoh Beng Hock, held in her right hand a bouquet of chrysanthemums in token of her brother’s tragic death when being interrogated by the MACC (Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission) in 2009.”"

Domesticated Politics emerged from her current series of works that are constituted by the material remnants of the Malaysian 13th General Election that occurred in May 2013. In Kuik’s hands, the paraphernalia, banners and flags from the various parties, advertisements and much more examine the meaning of a today’s national state in contrast to something which should be very familiar to everybody called globalization. In these works, Kuik explores the dynamics between the personal and the political, and how such relations influence a person’s worldview. Her personal identity as Sino- Malaysian, female artist has led her to experiment – in Domesticated Politics – with the concept of domestication: to feminize, to soften the once exuberant, masculine and heroic objects, to make these flags immobile and impotent.”  She is seen folding, ironing, and assembling the triangle flags on the floor. By following the proportion of the national flag of Malaysia, these DIY flags are made smaller in the form of pillowcases. At the front of the flags, the movement of the working hands serves as a motif running through the sequence of nine images recomposed according to their visual rhythm. At the back of each flag is a fabric of a colorful pattern, used to suggest the people who are wearing it – the anonymous voters like herself, gives the front image – the necessary solidarity."

It is only after gazing and scrutinizing the works for longer that one starts to recognise the marks of painterly strokes and it is with this observation that the viewer possibly admits an overly quick reading of the work; the works are surely paintings. But they are not. To describe them, as natural and built surfaces, captured in time, would not be incorrect nor is describing the works as paintings, for within this series one finds both; Cycles of Old and New, Constant Flux and Natural Law are paintings on ice blocks that have been captured on film and presented on canvas. Cycle of Old and New, Constant Flux and Natural Law were first shown at Lorn’s solo show, Yesterday, No More, held in 2012 at Java Arts in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. A show that was 6-years in the making, Yesterday, No More and Lorn’s continued experimentations with ice block painting and photography represents one of the more unique practices to hail from the Indochina area today. The practice of using blocks of ice as his canvas departs from Lorn’s experience as a child when he moved to the Thai border in the 1990s to escape the Khmer Rouge’s continuing terror. “Those nights were very cold,” he plainly states. With his art, he says, “I try to remind myself about all those memories.”   The painting featured here illustrates how Lorn felt during those nights. Lorn’s fascination with the forces of the cold temperatures that wrapped around and penetrated him are expressed in this painting and it is this proximity and intimicy that drew him to exploring ice blocks as a medium. The operation of moving quickly, and of working through the continual shifting and changing of the previous layers of paint against a melting canvas, forces Lorn to relinquish his sense of control over the medium he is attempting to wield and to give in and embrace the effects of the paints’ reaction against the melting ice; the motions of applying the paint are as much the artwork as the final photograph we see before us.  Containing notions of chance, transformation and impermenance, and with titles like, Cycle of Old and New, Constant Flux and Natural Law, Lorn’s works can be described as reflections of the life cycle and indeed the idea of transformation and impermenance as emphasised in the Buddhist reglion is something Lorn regards as a strong movement in his work: “My photographs are what’s left behind, like a memory,” he suggests, “and this I think is the connection between my work and the dharma”  which in Buddhism, refers to the law and order of the cosmos. Leoum Lorn (b. 1982, Cambodia) studied Visual Art at Phare Ponleu Selpak in Battambang, graduating in 2005. He works in photography, video and performance and has exhibited in Battambang and Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Paris, France. He currently runs a gallery in Battambang with his wife."

Lorn’s fascination with the forces of the cold temperatures that wrapped around and penetrated him are expressed in this painting and it is this proximity and intimicy that drew him to exploring ice blocks as a medium. The operation of moving quickly, and of working through the continual shifting and changing of the previous layers of paint against a melting canvas, forces Lorn to relinquish his sense of control over the medium he is attempting to wield and to give in and embrace the effects of the paints’ reaction against the melting ice; the motions of applying the paint are as much the artwork as the final photograph we see before us.  Containing notions of chance, transformation and impermenance, and with titles like, Cycle of Old and New, Constant Flux and Natural Law, Lorn’s works can be described as reflections of the life cycle and indeed the idea of transformation and impermenance as emphasised in the Buddhist reglion is something Lorn regards as a strong movement in his work: “My photographs are what’s left behind, like a memory,” he suggests, “and this I think is the connection between my work and the dharma”  which in Buddhism, refers to the law and order of the cosmos.

Dense with the vertical whiteness of over 400 PVC pipes, Every Point of View invokes the multi-pillared Parthenon in Athens, coincidentally the birthplace of democracy as an ideal and practice. 
Wandering amidst the forest of pipes, a viewer fleetingly encounters perspectives on the idea of ‘Democracy’. Ten representatives of particular demographics were invited to respond to two questions about ‘Democracy’, and the written responses were projected and traced onto the pipes. At specific points, the pipes become a continuous surface, where each statement is ‘jigsawed’ into coherence. Operating on the dynamics of anamorphic perception, only exact viewer positioning enables each statement to be read: the instant the viewer steps away from this tightly configured point, the perspective vanishes. These perspectives on democracy are experienced as moments of surveilled epiphany, as live camera feedback captures real-time footage at those points, which is projected in a separate space. A soundscape of murmurings of enunciations on democracy by elected office-bearers and public figures is also ‘piped’ through the installation, and viewers become listeners and speakers too – speaking into, or listening from openings on certain pipes. The artist sees the work as “analogous” to the democratic process: that democracy “is an understanding that different viewpoints exist and that it is within this acknowledgment that ways to co-exist are devised consensually and sometimes, not so.”
Matthew Ngui (born in 1962, Singapore) is a visual artist, trained in sculpture and now working in the areas of installation, video, performance, site-specific works and public art. He has exhibited locally and internationally in contemporary art museums and spaces in cities such as Berlin, Bordeaux, Copenhagen, Graz, Hong Kong, London, Manila and Vienna. Participating in the São Paulo (1996), Venice (2001) and Gwangju Biennales (2002) and the tenth Documenta in 1997, Ngui focuses on site-specific installations and performances that engage the locality and people of the city and space in which the work is exhibited.

European designs were also adapted to suit Peranakan taste, such as the addition of Chinese motifs, gliding and mother-of-pearl inlays.  This fusion of influences and trends was also evident in Peranakan fashion and jewellery, and is one of the defining characteristics of Peranakan material culture."

His practice is centered on the mediums of painting, sculpture and installation, and is often concerned with issues of materiality and tactility.  Commissioned for the 2016 Singapore Biennale (“An Atlas of Mirrors”), Faizal’s installation, Dollah Jawa, proffers the intersection of dual histories, macro and micro. In the telling of two intertwined tales, it engages on one hand with the neglected history of forced migration in Southeast Asia during the Second World War, and, on the other with the artist’s personal family history, which was the result of broader developments in the trajectory of the region’s past. Faizal’s grandfather, who hailed from West Java, was one of many Javanese who were forcefully expatriated to Brunei by the Japanese Army to serve the imperial troops during the war. He stayed on after the occupation ended, marrying a local woman and raising a family there. Those convergent historical vectors are materialised here in the form of visual images. Like dimly remembered figures from the past, or hazy memories of events occluded by dominant historical accounts, these images are cast as blurry projections on either side of a screen of fabric, the lack of pictorial definition seeming almost to serve as a metaphor for the erosive work of the passage of time. On one side of the screen, old photographs featuring Faizal’s grandfather – official portraits, sepia-tinged family snapshots – suggest familial ties, with some featuring fragments of scribbled notes on the back. On the other side are archival images from the Japanese Occupation in Brunei, which occurred from 1941 to 1945: these include, among others, the photograph of the arrival of Japanese troops in the sultanate, the then Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin with members of the occupying forces, an example of the ‘banana’ currency used during the occupation, and the Japanese surrender to the Australians at the end of the war."

Sensationally too, The Wait draws the viewer to reflect on notions of identity, isolation and loneliness, echoing the impressions presented in Hopper and Ruscha’s renowned works. Stylistically, The Wait’s painterly quality arises out of the various ‘lines’ that cross the screen: the harsh horizontal and vertical lines marked out by the petrol station’s stationary silhouette along with the ‘green’ and ‘red’ taxis that brush past the screen work together to create a dynamic landscape that evokes both a sense of ‘stability’ and ‘instability’ that hangs in a fine balance. Through carefully crafted edits, that result in one footage presenting only available taxis and the other featuring only unavailable taxis, The Wait plays on the familiar emotions of satisfaction and frustration witnessed by individuals who attempt to hail taxis; “I edited the video separating the available and unavailable taxis, thereby also removing the actual waiting time of six hours. Then I stitched them all together into two separate channels, the taxis emerging continuously, seamlessly without wait,” explained the artist."

Tiravanija’s invitation of audience participation through staging social events not usually undertaken within a gallery context informed the influential concept of ‘relational aesthetics’, coined by French curator Nicolas Bourriaud, which had a major impact on contemporary art in the 1990s. 

untitled 2014 (curry for the soul of the forgotten) is a development of Tiravanija’s renowned cooking performances, which he began in 1990. It features a bronze cookpot, evocative of ancient sculpture, which has been used to cook Thai curry near Tiravanija’s home in Chiang Mai. The accompanying video projection depicts the curry being cooked in the pot, as ‘documentation’ of the action. While the curry is cooking, the pot mysteriously moves across the platform, creating a sense of anticipation that is not entirely resolved.

Is it possible for an artist to look beyond officially constructed maps, and imagine a different past or an alternate future? Pothupitiye attempts to do so in this series, where he re-crafts the official version of maps to tell a different story. The maps he constructs are like palimpsests where he overlays, juxtaposes and transforms portraits of voyages, landscapes, mythical figures and other maps to re-inscribe stories of Sri Lanka’s past and present, interspersed with his own personal history. The maps he refers to range from Ptolemy’s maps of Ceylon to current maps of Sri Lanka. His atlas of maps tells many different stories simultaneously: of the deep scars of colonialism, the civil unrest and religious extremism of recent years, and also the lyrical beauty of a country that was once called Ceylon.

Born into a traditional southern Sri Lankan caste of craft artists and ritualists, he incorporates and reinterprets the material and philosophical content of traditional art, to confront issues such as colonialism, nationalism, religious extremism and militarism, and extends his inquiry to questions of caste, the distinction between art and craft, tradition and modernity, as well as a critique of Eurocentrism. In 2005, he participated in the Fukuoka Asian Art Triennial and in 2010, he received the Sovereign Asian Art Prize. Pothupitiye is a founding member of the Theertha International Artists Collective."

Karagatan portrays the eyes of residents in coastal villages across the Philippines, ranging from fishermen to pearl divers, a master boat-builder to shell traders and others. The results of the artist’s research are delicate paintings that capture the tiny, distinctive characteristics of each subject’s eye: lines, curves and contours, which transform into unusual and unexpected portraits. As miniatures, the works draw upon a hallowed tradition associated with the royal courts, yet here, these tiny portraits map a community of coastal people who labour to harvest the bounty of the ocean but rarely reap its wealth. Halili pays homage to people whose fates and fortunes are bound to the ocean, limning their likeness on precious mother-of-pearl gleaned from the deep. Gregory Halili (b. 1975, Manila, the Philippines) carves and paints mother-of-pearl shells, creating memento moris. He received his BFA from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and spent 25 years in the USA before returning to the Philippines. His work focuses on the art of miniatures, and he is interested in notions of memory, life, death and cycles. His work has appeared in numerous exhibitions and shows, including the Hammond Museum and Sculpture Garden (Salem, New York, 2001), Butler Institute of American Art (Youngstown, Ohio, USA, 2002), John Michael Kohler Arts Center (Sheboygan, Wisconsin, USA, 2003–2004), Nancy Hoffman Gallery (New York, 2014) and Silverlens Gallery (Singapore, 2015), and in the Philippines at the Ayala Museum (Makati City, 2005), Jorge B.

Both Raffles and Sultan Hussein played pivotal roles in the signing of two treaties that resulted in the founding of modern Singapore, and this artwork seeks to uncover the relationships between them.

Drawing on these personal experiences, the work which features 3 hand-sculpted monkeys invading a home-space is intended by the artist to portray the undesired disturbances which proliferate though multiple aspects of our everyday life – be it in within the private sphere, public spheres, or political spheres. The presence of the monkeys juxtaposes the otherwise neat and ordered space – and because within the same space, the civilised and the uncivilised are brought together to make clear that the “primitive” is not one of another time, but exists in simultaneity with the modern. While the monkeys have been portrayed as being relatively tame at the point in time when they are spotted, with destruction of the space still limited to some displaced books and partially torn page, the sense of impending chaos looms heavily on the scene – lest negotiations/actions take place promptly to circumvent the expected consequence.  It is in this regard that Monkeys in the House do not merely serve as a visual analogy for the range of similar situations which seemingly proliferate our lives, but a parable on arresting these problems before situations worsen or they get completely out of hand."

Furthermore, the structure of Rat House, 2014 in being seemingly comprised by a multitude of smaller houses stands as a mirroring of contemporary living conditions in which people living in cities with high population densities often find themselves accommodated in shoebox apartments as they live out their lives in a perpetual “rat-race”.  In resurrecting a contemporary iteration of the tradition rat house, Sakarin’s use of tempera paints for the designs and motifs of the house pays homage to century old traditions of Thai art-making practices, effectively re-introducing to audiences an age old artefact re-inscribed with issues of the contemporary."

As shown in this example, Zao's abstract schema is often framed within stable and simplified structures sectioned by horizontal segments.

Born in Can Tho in Vietnam’s south in 1941, Nguy?n Lâm came to prominence at an early age. He was a member of the Saigon Young Artist’s Association, a dynamic group of artists who strove to bring greater innovation to the art scene in Saigon. He was selected for representation in many international platforms in the period, including the Paris biennales of 1961 and 1963, and the Sao Paulo biennale of 1967. He was also one of the youngest Vietnamese artists to be represented at Saigon’s First International Art Exhibition of 1962. This artwork is a semi-abstract composition imbued with symbolic references. It represents a textured, off-white field of colour, traversed by a dark channel. Figured subtly within the central channel of paint is the image of a corpse, while a pair of traditional Vietnamese wooden shoes interrupt the composition in the bottom right corner. The work is a mediation on life and death, and the traces of life remaining after death."

Beginning to paint in the early 1990s, his work turned away from creating picturesque images of Cambodia, instead creating autobiographical or narrative images in a naïve style, connecting the grand narratives of Cambodian history and culture to the intimacy of daily life. The painting Hotel Le Royal documents the scene of the dining room in the hotel where Svay Ken worked for many years of his life. Painted in his characteristic, brightly-coloured naïve style, the work is rich with visually-engaging anecdotal observations of life in Cambodia in the 1990s. On the left-hand side of the work, a gathering of Asian officials attend a formal banquet.Elsewhere in the dining room, foreign, Western couples dine in luxury. Cambodian figures are present in the image only as workers: serving diners in the hall, or in the upper right section devoted to the chefs. The work therefore represents the social divide in Cambodia between wealthy foreign visitors and local Cambodians, as Cambodia was newly emerging from the privations of decades of civil war and the trauma of the Khmer Rouge period."

Used to symbolize the three red ‘houses’ of communism in the region – China, Vietnam and Laos, this work casually accesses the influence of China and Vietnam in Laos through the documenting of its changing scenery. In one image, we can imagine ourselves bearing witness to the crude unfurling of sky rise buildings that Chinese investment companies have been backing in under-tapped Laos. The bizarreness of sky scrapers as they abruptly punctuate the horizon line are significant as a demonstration of how China is attempting to gain a footing into Southeast Asia: swiftly and crudely.

(The exhibition was curated by Malaysian gallerist Valentine Willie.) To date, Wong’s oeuvre had largely comprised brightly-coloured oil paintings reminiscent of Gauguin, but in the mid-1990s his practice took a turn: while still critically engaged with the historical and socio-political landscape of Malaysia, his works began to embrace contemporary forms like performance, installation and new media. The work emerged from a significant period in Wong’s artistic practice. The period of Wong’s artistic career from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, in fact, coincided with a transitional moment in Malaysia’s politics (with the latter informing and inspiring the former). Wong was deeply engaged with the issues and concerns that reflect the trajectories of his country’s post-war development – an era that saw the emergence of Malaysia as one of the leading economies of SE Asia, but one that also witnessed the rise of racialism and race-based politics. In the late 1990s, the Reformasi movement arose from the very visible fallout that occurred in the wake of Anwar Ibrahim’s deposition by then-PM Mahathir: an active citizenry was mobilized to call for deep, structural reforms in the nation’s notoriously corruption-laden political culture, and Wong found himself caught up – both personally and artistically – in the tumult. The “New Migrants” series was first show in the aforementioned exhibition, which also included the “Migrants” series (which consisted of five large drawings detailing the history of Wong’s own Sino-Malaysian family), “History of Rubber and Labour” (an installation documenting the rubber trade in Malaysia and the migrant labour that sustained it). “New Migrants” was a series of ten, large-scale portraits – of, literally recent immigrants to Malaysia, generally of the blue-collar variety and hailing from poorer countries in Asia – rendered in charcoal, on paper."

Seas and oceans have often been regarded as territories to be charted and conquered. Yet to actually voyage on watery expanses is to exist in a liminal space: always a ‘somewhere’ between leaving and arriving, and a ‘nowhere’ forever surrounded by ever-changing wind and weather conditions. This multimedia installation brings together material Atienza recorded from four oceanic journeys on cargo ships, and immerses the viewer in the constant state of flux that characterises life on board these vessels. As more than 400,000 Filipinos work ‘overseas’, this is an artistic journey that also finds echoes in the experiences of many of her countrymen. Endless is ultimately a work that reverberates close to home for Atienza – almost all her family is involved in the maritime industry, including her grandfather who was a lighthouse keeper.

The work of Martha Atienza (b. 1981, Manila, the Philippines) is sociological in nature, reflecting a keen observation of her immediate environment. She understands her surroundings as a landscape of people, first and foremost, and is currently investigating the usage of art as a tool for effecting social change and development. Atienza received her BFA from the AKI Academy of Art and Design in Enschede, the Netherlands and has participated in the art programme at the Kuvataideakatemia of the University of the Arts Helsinki, Finland. In 2015, she received the Thirteen Artists Award from the Cultural Center of the Philippines, and in 2012, she received the Ateneo Arts Award, with residency grants in Liverpool, Melbourne, New York and Singapore. In 2016, she was the recipient of the first Mercedes Zobel/Outset residency at the gallery Gasworks in London. She lives and works in Bantayan Island, the Philippines and Rotterdam, the Netherlands."

Part of Chua’s ‘Unnatural History Drawings’, the shaped canvas takes as its starting point, the extensive collection of natural history drawings that were commissioned by William Farquhar in the early 19th century. With an abiding interest to explore abstraction in painting, the work also incorporates the ultrasound image as a means to probe the relationship between sound and vision, and how sensorial experiences can translate across one other. Chua’s use of the ultrasound gestures towards the realm of possibility of what lies beyond the range of human sensory detection, as made realisable by science and technology. 

Cicada #2 evokes the shape of the insect delicately unfolding its damp wings after its period of dormancy, a phase and life ‘lived’ buried underground for 17 years for some species of cicadas. Waking as a thunderous force after dormancy, the cicadas collectively produce a deafening song during the mating season, only to die shortly after. Sex and impending demise are conjoined in the cicada song, a sonic cry that finds translation into the visual realm through the ultrasound pattern on the painting’s surface that is rendered based on the cicadas’ mating call. 

Genevieve Chua (b. 1984, Singapore) is a visual artist who works primarily through abstraction. Selected solo exhibitions include “Rehearsals for the Wilful” (Manila, 2016); “Parabola” (Singapore, 2014); and “Cicadas Cicadas” (Los Angeles, 2014). She has also participated in the Singapore Biennale (2011), and was the Young Artist Award in 2012 conferred by the National Arts Council, Singapore."

The Moth series, the second of the arcs, draws upon Darwinian hypothesis that living creatures’ characteristics or forms evolve to over time, through a process of beneficial mutations. In this instance, the paintings revolve around a moth with an unusually long proboscis that enables it to pollinate a species of orchid with a highly elongated nectary. Evolution of the moth and orchid have thus unfolded in tandem, a progression in parallel. The symmetrical shape of Moth #5 calls to mind the insect’s form at rest, and the ultrasound patterns which were derived from the vibratory patterns of the walls or ground on which the moths were perched.

Genevieve Chua (b. 1984, Singapore) is a visual artist who works primarily through abstraction. Chua pursues an unfurling narrative that is informed by natural history and linguistics.

Some had been partially destroyed by dust and the elements, resulting in a mottled appearance blighted by dirt, insects and even mould. After collecting all the images, he re-photographed each one in the studio, treating them as dimensional objects marked by the detritus of time. For the artist, these found photographs came to be a metaphor for the corruptibility of ideals and order as embodied in the law. Preventive laws promulgated into the constitution, which give the police the power to detain suspects without presenting any evidence of wrongdoing before a court of law, is a prerogative that has historically been used to suppress political opposition and civil activism in many countries. Thus, in addition to their law enforcement functions, the police also play a large part in national security, and such power without accountability can, and does lead to the tendency to abuse that very power. In Malaysia, the annual Bersih (the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections) rallies have been the site of alleged use of excessive force by the police, leading to criticism and probes by independent advisory panels. In Royal Malaysia Police, what is put under investigation is the reliance on the photograph’s power to verify identity – both for the police and the criminal. The artist’s documentary processes testify to the neutrality and material susceptibility of the photograph as witness, evidence and reference."

He spent almost seven years in jail (1998–2004) for political reasons; during this time he developed his artistic practice by using bowls and cigarette lighters, in the absence of brushes, to make paintings and monoprints on prison uniforms. After his release, he moved to London in 2006, but returned to Myanmar in 2013. Soap Blocked was one of two Burmese projects included in the 2016 Singapore Biennale (“An Atlas of Mirrors”). It comprises a map of Myanmar, painstakingly constructed of a thousand squares of sculpted Shwe Wah soap, and stands as testament to the vicissitudes of Htein Lin’s tumultuous life. Having participated in the failed uprising of 1988 – an event commemorated today as a milestone in the country’s march towards the establishment of a democratic polity – he was forced to flee underground, spending several years in refugee camps on the border. He escaped and returned to Yangon in the early 1990s, but was again arrested and jailed on charges of opposition activity; he subsequently spent almost seven years behind bars and was released only in 2004. During this time he turned to art. In the absence of proper art-making tools, he used what meagre materials were made available to him to produce works on scraps of fabric, on prison uniforms – and in soap. One of the works that emerged from this period was a little carving of a captive human figure, hunched over and trapped within the claustrophobic confines of four walls, sculpted from a bar of Shwe Wah soap. The carving was smuggled out by a Red Cross representative after a prison visit in 1999, as a means of conveying to the rest of the world the deplorable state of the country’s prisons. Soap Blocked returns to the original moment of the artist’s desperate, clandestine plea. The installation maps and reflects the experience of thousands of political prisoners in Myanmar in recent decades, including the artist’s own incarceration. The work amplifies autobiographical resonance into a starkly visceral monument to the collective helplessness that the people of the country often faced during the years of socialist military rule."

(b. 1944, Guandong province, China) is a noted Chinese ink and calligraphy artist who has been affiliated with contemporary Chinese ink development in Singapore. Currently residing in Suzhou China, he had a history of studying and exhibiting in Singapore. He studied art at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore and was tutored by the Singapore ink master Shi Xiang Tuo. A Nanyang University graduate, he pursued further studies at the University of Nice, France and the Monterey Institute of International Studies, California USA in the 1980s. He also studied printmaking at the Cornish College of Arts, Seattle in 1988 and obtained his Masters of Fine Art at the University of Washington in 1990.
This monumental ink work exemplifies Zhuang’s distillation of calligraphic and ink brush work and the aesthetic sensibilities of American Expressionism. In particular, Zhuang found affinity with the practice of Jackson Pollock, whose works he encountered directly and closely at the museums with his move to the USA in 1987. Through this interface, Zhuang explored compositions that were bolder in scale and more complex in composition – producing depth and nuances in tonal values.  
 
The vigour and improvisational quality of Zhuang’s brushwork belies the discipline and compositional decisions determining the balance between ink and void. The notion of ‘Origin’ also captures the theme of Zhuang’s artistic preoccupations in probing both Chinese and western canons of art-making. Trained and mentored by Shi Xiang Tuo, Zhuang had risen to attention through his calligraphy and the principles of the calligraphic brush work have permeated his ink paintings."

His oil paintings are marked by gestural and expressive brushwork, reinforcing affiliations with American abstract expressionism that shaped his formative years in New York; his paint handling also acknowledges debt to his grounding and fervor for calligraphy and Chinese ink particularly of the xieyi school.  
Wong had been tutored by Liu Kang and mentored intensively by Chen Wen Hsi. He participated in local exhibitions from 1956, with a solo exhibition at the National Library in 1961 before leaving for the USA, enrolling at the Art Students League of New York (1961-65) and later St Martin’s School of Art London (entered in 1966). He excelled in school and actively exhibited, receiving the Ford Foundation tuition grant in 1964 and the Edward G. McDowell Travelling Scholarship the following year that enabled him to tour Europe and the UK. He took on art related jobs including as an art instructor and art director in New York and continued to paint - winning the Consul-Gen of Japan Award in 1967, In the late 1970s he established a frame shop Keen’s Gallery and eventually an art gallery for emerging artists. He returned to art professionally and began to exhibit in Singapore. 

While this work was produced during Wong’s student years, it is important to note that Wong was actively exhibiting and excelling during these ‘school years’. He was the recipient of the Ford Foundation tuition scholarship just a year earlier, in 1964; and the year this work was made was the year he won the Edward G. McDowell Travelling Scholarship – marking the first for a Singaporean recipient. The latter scholarship allowed Wong to travel to Europe and London.  
During this time, he met up with his mentor Chen Wen Hsi who was in Europe at this time for his own exhibitions. Chen apparently brought along some Chinese art materials with which Wong used to produce several works. It has been noted in several texts that Wong has a strong link with calligraphy even from early years, formatively shaped by his mother, the late calligrapher Chu Hen-Ai. This painting bears a scripted verse alongside a more amorphous, ambivalent form and two slim brush strokes, rendered strategically. It is unclear whether this work should be read with the other work (forming a pair) or whether they could also be treated as independently."

(sometimes Ling Mu Hua) [1936-2008] is reputed as one of Singapore’s leading printmakers, in particular in the woodcut and woodblock printmaking techniques. A respected art educator and alumnus of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (graduating in 1955), his oeuvre was far more extensive that popularly assumed. Lim was also highly proficient in pastel and charcoal drawing, Chinese ink and Western painting, exploring figuration, landscapes and still-life. He taught at NAFA from 1960-69 before leaving to work at the Nanyang Siang Pau (a Chinese newspaper), becoming its Art Editor from 1969-1975. He later set up his own printing company but continued to be active in various art capacities throughout his life. He was honorary advisor to the Lee Kong Chian Art Museum from 1970 to 1980); and Senior Researcher for the Xu Bei Hong Memorial Hall in Nanjing in 2001 and Visiting Professor at the Inner Mongolian Eastern Cultural Museum, China in 2002. Lim’s monumental public art mural for the Esplanade SMRT station was completed in the year of his passing.  

The interest in Lim’s woodcut prowess has often eclipsed his proficient and interesting painting portfolio. He has been celebrated largely for his detailed woodcutting imagery derived from street theatre and puppetry as well as distinctly local and regional activities such as fishing or gathering toddy.  

This self portrait painting presents another facet of Lim’s practice that merits more attention. This is a self-portrait of the artist when he was 27 years old. It is an intriguing phase not only within Lim’s oeuvre but also in the larger discussion of Surrealist and Symbolist influences or their variants in Singapore art development. That this was executed in 1963 throws light and insight on this area of research at this particular juncture of art history here and in the region. During this period, Lim was teaching art at NAFA; he was also producing woodcuts, drawings and cartoons.  
In this unusually small portrait, Lim’s self-depiction is dense with details that are open to interpretative possibilities. He dons spectacles but his eye-glasses appear snapped off so that only 1 side of the framed lens is left. The reflection appears to capture images of abstract paintings, possibly of those surrounding him in the studio or space he is in. The green tinge in this work is characteristic of surrealist-influenced works. This work also adds to the area of artist’s self-representations – an area of interest for museum curators and historians."

He was involved in filmmaking in the film community of Nanjing.  
He was one of the founding members of the Penang Chinese Art Club (or Yin Yin Art Society) in 1935, along with Kuo Ju Ping as well as Yong Mun Sen. At the onset of the 2nd Sino-Japanese war in 1937, he returned to Perak and was persuaded to teach art by Kuo in Penang. He relocated to Singapore, becoming an early teacher of Western Art at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in 1940, where he also took up the appointment of Head of Guidance Counselling. He left after a year and later set up the Hai Xia Art Supplies Company (Straits Commercial Art Co.) with former NAFA alumnus Tay Long that provided advertising signages as well as sold paintings alongside supplies in its early years. The partnership ended a few years later and Chong left Singapore. His practice is sometimes framed with Chen Jen Hao, Huang Baofang and Tchang Ju Chi. He eventually resettled in Hong Kong.

The outlines of his turban, his green jacket and scarlet background are rendered as segments of unmodulated and sometimes striking colour, evidencing the influence of Fauvist ways of rendering flat areas of pure, vivid colour."

Several contexts may be forged in assessing her work – as the rare female presence in the male-dominated art scene of the 1960s and 70s that could be framed comparatively with Lai Foong Moi (1931-1994) and Sunyee (1919-2009); as a practitioner of faux naïve painting and printmaking; as a founding member of the seminal Ten Men Art Group (later the SEAsian Art Association) and her relationships with a notable network of artists that included her brother, the artist Tan Teo Kwang.  
 
Chen was trained at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (1950-54), where she studied under Cheong Soo Pieng and Lim Hak Tai as well as calligraphy under Chui Ta Tee. Her classmates included Lim Yew Kuan and Choo Keng Kwang. She was fluent in Chinese, English and French – working as the Bank of China’s interpreter for 20 years. Her ‘signature style’ is marked by flat, rudimentary rendering and a marked simplicity in form and colour. This faux naïve sensibility seemed particularly suited for her subjects that included folk communities and cultures in the region. Notable exhibitions include her solo exhibitions at the Museo de Arte Contemporanio de Oaxaca (1980, Mexico), Lasting Impressions, Printmaking (2006, Singapore) and Joie de Vivre: Chen Cheng Mei (2014, NAFA Galleries, Singapore).

This painting may be read in the context of Chen’s art expeditions with the Ten Men Art Group - a casual group that was formalized as the Southeast Asian Art Association by the time this work was produced in 1973."

Born Yong Yen Lang in Kuching, Sarawak Malaysia and was formally trained in calligraphy and Chinese ink painting in Guan-dong, China. In 1918, he worked in a bookstore in Singapore and in 1922 was transferred to the Penang branch of this store. He adopted this artist name of Mun Sen this same year and established his well-known art studios for art, sculpture and photography – the Tai Woon/Wei Guan Art Studio (renamed Mun Sen Studio in 1930). The studio was to become a meeting point for other leading artists of the time.  
 
He was one of the rallying forces behind the formation of key art societies including the Penang Chinese Art Club and Singapore Chinese Art Club, both formed in 1935. At his height Yong actively exhibited in America, UK, Malaysia and Singapore. He held exhibitions in Singapore from 1947 to 1953 at the Victoria Memorial Hall, Robinsons & Co. and John Littles, many of which were fundraisers for various causes including University Endowments, discharged prisoners, nurses’ welfare and campaigns against tuberculosis. 

While Yong is principally known for his naturalistic, expressive renditions of landscapes and landmarks in watercolour, he was also an accomplished oil painter who found an affinity with Paul Gauguin and his depictions of native subjects in Tahiti.  
 
The influence of Gauguin is discernible in Yong’s studies and rendering of regional subjects when he was travelling extensively throughout Malaya particularly in the 1940s and early 50s. This may be seen in the treatment of this subject as well as in a work already in the NGS Collection (Ref: Relaxing, c 1940s).  
 
The female subject in a sarong, is depicted in a pose that would be familiar to many in the region. Her arms are wrapped around her child who is hoisted to her side or hip, as is a common sight in many kampong dwellings. Both are rendered as being dark complexioned, their forms seamlessly melding one to the other - suggesting the strong bond between mother and child. This painting was featured in the exhibition Pioneers (2007, Valentine Willie Fine Art, KL) and dated 1940 during that exhibition."

His oil paintings are marked by gestural and expressive brushwork, reinforcing affiliations with American abstract expressionism that shaped his formative years in New York; his paint handling also acknowledges debt to his grounding and fervor for calligraphy and Chinese ink particularly of the xieyi school.  

While this work was produced during Wong’s student years, it is important to note that Wong was actively exhibiting and excelling during these ‘school years’. He was the recipient of the Ford Foundation tuition scholarship just a year earlier, in 1964; and the year this work was made was the year he won the Edward G. McDowell Travelling Scholarship – marking the first for a Singaporean recipient. The latter scholarship allowed Wong to travel to Europe and London.  
 Wong had been tutored by Liu Kang and mentored intensively by Chen Wen Hsi. He participated in local exhibitions from 1956, with a solo exhibition at the National Library in 1961 before leaving for the USA, enrolling at the Art Students League of New York (1961-65) and later St Martin’s School of Art London (entered in 1966). He excelled in school and actively exhibited, receiving the Ford Foundation tuition grant in 1964 and the Edward G. McDowell Travelling Scholarship the following year that enabled him to tour Europe and the UK. He took on art related jobs including as an art instructor and art director in New York and continued to paint - winning the Consul-Gen of Japan Award in 1967, In the late 1970s he established a frame shop Keen’s Gallery and eventually an art gallery for emerging artists. He returned to art professionally and began to exhibit in Singapore."

Raised in Klang, Malaysia, and having attended art school in Singapore, she is today based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Knitting the Future was first staged in Venice in 2015, and was included in the 2016 Singapore Biennale (“An Atlas of Mirrors”), where it was one of several performative pieces. For a period of five weeks, for six days a week and six hours a day, Chia engaged in a marathon knitting session – except that her material of choice is not yarn, but the leek. Clad in a long black dress, sitting in the middle of a gallery space likewise fitted out in black, her ultimate goal is the completion of a full-length garment – or “body armour”, as she dubs it – woven entirely from thousands of skeins of leek. Chia  is of Teochew stock, the descendant of Chinese immigrants to Malaysia. While based in Sweden, her ethnic and cultural identity is integral to her artistic practice, especially at a stage in her life that has seen her displaced from Southeast Asia. The piece is informed by her Teochew roots, but Chia is also concerned about environmental issues. It occupies a central place in the culinary and cultural consciousness of the Teochew people of the Chaoshan region in southern China. It – or its close relatives, the scallion or garlic green – is a staple at the family meal during the annual reunion feast on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The generic Mandarin term for allium vegetables, suan (?), is a homophone with the verb ‘to count’ (?), and an old adage goes, ‘If one ate leek, there would be money to keep’."

The royal palace was a centre that attracted the most skilled craftsmen, an artistic elite, who formed a guild called ‘Pattal Hatara’. Members included painters, jewellers, gold and silversmiths and ivory workers. These same skilled workers were also involved in building and decorating the temples found throughout Kandy. They enjoyed the King’s protection and received royal donations. Their presence attracted other artists such as dancers and musicians to the court and the Kings of Kandy became famed for their patronage of the arts. 

This ivory figurine is a depiction of a Sri Lankan nobleman or dignitary standing on a small pedestal. The artist has engraved vertical lines into the figurine’s wide, double-layered collar that covers his shoulders, and also on his trousers and shirt cuffs. Wavy, horizontal lines have also been carved into his sleeves. He wears a long tunic (bo-hettya) which has five hanging pendants; four rest upon the front and back of his thighs while a larger one hangs upon his back underneath the layers of his collar. The figurine is adorned with three long necklaces with flower shaped pendants and he wears a flower shaped ring on each hand. He has a rotund, rather elaborate hat on his head and his hair is carefully parted and tied in a knot. He wears a benevolent expression, with closed eyes and boasts a magnificent handlebar moustache. His facial expression denotes a devout aspect. The figurine is exquisitely finished on the back, where the careful detailing and depth in carving continues. The relatively small size of the figure emphasizes the artist’s masterful skill in carving. 

Statuettes of kings, other royalty and the nobility – as well as ordinary men and women – are common in ivory dating from this period. They are particularly useful as records of costume of the royalty and nobility. The model for this piece might have been a member of the royal family, perhaps a prince or king. Such portraits are rare and would have probably been commissioned and produced as diplomatic gifts."

Ranging from everyday objects, armoury, gaming pieces to furniture were crafted in workshops around India for the colonial market. Mother of pearl workshops in Gujarat and Rajasthan produced furniture and other decorative objects for the luxury European market. 

The powder flask is made from wood in the form of a mollusc or a nautilus shell. The top of the object has been inlaid with mother of pearl against a dark brown ground. The pattern features alternating geometric shapes; on the very top, there are angular undulating lines decorated with eye-like circles, below (and around the body of the flask) a leaf-like pendant and circular dots are arranged in the shape of a cross.

Indian powder flasks are often elegant, exhibiting intricate carving and precious inlaid decoration, and are sometimes covered with leather or fabric. 

Such flasks were produced by craftsmen of the Khatri caste in the Kotah state of the 19th centuryt. Such objects were popular after their inclusion in exhibitions such as the Colonial and Indian exhibition held in London in 1886, in much demand there after."

For this work, Barman spent time in Singapore chronicling the conversations and poetry of Bangladeshi migrant labourers,and translated them into skeletal-sculptures referencing pre-war Singapore shophouse fronts and rust-transferred drawings. These works evoke images of homes left behind, aspirations towards future homes and  the present feeling of homelessness. In the artist’s words, “transferring rust impressions onto paper, casting abandoned domestic objects in concrete and welding re-used construction iron bars in realising skeletal definitions of homes are more like sculpting from memory – reconstructions rusted in time”. (Text by Suman Gopinath, Singapore Biennale 2016 Assoc. curator, and curator of the artwork)

The recent art practice of Rathin Barman (b. 1981, Tripura, India) focuses on urban architecture and architectural forms. He has documented different layers of architectural progress that unveil the structural evolution of the contemporary urban landscape, while at the same time commenting on sociopolitical issues. His recent solo exhibition ‘No … I Remember It Well’ at Experimenter (Kolkata, 2015) emerged from the idea of ‘home’ shaped by conversations with and amidst people displaced since 1947 from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). He transformed their memories into sculptural forms and, in the process, recreated remembered homes and landscapes. Barman has previously had two solo exhibitions and exhibited widely in India and around the world. He is involved in the public art project Edge Effect, curated by Kanchi Mehta, a Kochi-Muziris Biennale project (Kochi, India, 2014). He lives and works in Kolkata, India."

The wave is a recurring motif that features in numerous of Dusadee’s sculptures and drawings. Stemming from how this memorable visit was during the monsoon season, the choppy conditions of the sea left a deep impression on Dusadee. Furthermore, since the primary purpose of the visit to Phuket was for surfing, Dusadee had watched his brother conquer these towering waves with both trepidation and pride – the flaccid penis affixed to the sculpture sheds light on the fear that the artist experienced as he watched his brother."

The porcelain rope seemingly defiant to the attraction of gravity lends the work a certain élan vital, and the work exudes an energy seemingly further amplified by two small egg-shaped pieces that rest upon the sculpture. What these “eggs” are are open to interpretation, and placement as well – and draw comparisons to a primordial cosmic egg, or when placed side-by-side, testicles as well. The wave motif present in other works from Dusadee also makes an appearance here.

He is known for his innovations in medium and was concerned with developing more indigenous materials for art as well cultivating ties with respective local communities. Both form and content then were important to him in developing a national art. This consciousness probably arose from when he was still a student in the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts. In particular, Bose recalled when his teacher, the abstractionist Constancio Bernardo, suggested he use “imported colours” to improve the colouring of his works. Santi is then quoted in one article in 1981 as saying “Our models in art are Western. Maybe, it’s time for us to make our own models. To be international is to be Filipino first. We have a broken tradition… and I’m going to try to mend in my own way.” 

“Drown My Soul in Chico River” (1981), also known as “Bury My Soul in Chico River,” is a work made by Santiago Bose in response to the protest of the Kalinga people, part of the ethnic group known as Igorots, to stop the Chico River dam project. The dam project would have permanently flooded their ancestral lands and despite being under the rule of Martial Law, the Kalinga people managed to successfully stop the project. It is an important subject matter reflecting the artist’s concerns on the issues of the local tribes/people from the Cordillera region where he was born. The title of the work comes partly from a book written in 1970, “Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West.” Bose, who spent time in the US, was influenced by the increased activism of minority groups there such as the American Indians.

Bose received the Thirteen Artists award in 1976 and his works are in the collections of Cultural Center of the Philippines, Queensland Art Gallery (Brisbane), Museum of Contemporary Art (Sydney), Western Front (Vancouver), Centro Wilfredo Lam (Havana) among others."

He was also the founder of the first progressive Chinese newspaper in Singapore (Thien Nan Shin Po) and championed the cause of women’s education. He donated $3,000 towards the fund of setting up Singapore Chinese Girls’ School in 1899. He was also a fervent supporter of the Reformist Movement in China and invited key reformist Kang Yu Wei to take refuge in Singapore, paying for all his expenses. 

Unfortunately, Khoo was not adept at managing his fortune and he was declared a bankrupt at age 34. He then earned a living working as an editor for various newspapers such as Cheng Nam Jit Poh, Nan Feng Ri Bao, Jue Hua Zhou Bao and Sin Chew Jit Poh.

The Vietnam chapter of this project took nearly two years (between 2011 and 2013) to produce and involved his travelling the length of Vietnam to understand the personal stories of the Vietnamese women and the half Vietnamese, half Japanese children that were ‘left behind’ by their Japanese military husbands or fathers.

Unfolding along a loose narrative, various individuals are met along the way, each of them has a singular – though not-always pleasant – encounter with the waters. History and personal memory are summoned too, through a brief voice-over from the last inhabitant of Singapore’s final remaining house by the sea.

Informed by Lim’s own experience as a former national sailor, the work is shaped by what the artist perceives as a paradoxical relationship that Singaporeans often have towards water and the sea. Growing up in a densely populated and highly urbanised environment, few residents on the island show a natural affinity for the very thing that circumscribes its shores. Nonetheless, water sits high on the national consciousness: regarded as a critical resource to ensure national security and survival, it is vigilantly managed and ordered. Yet at times, the human desire for order is upturned when Nature returns with fury in torrential downpours that have caused flash floods in the very heart of the city."

Chun (b. 1982), who by his own admission is “the quintessential object maker”, is interested in the study of what he terms “object biographies”, as a means of better understanding how everyday objects function as a reflection of personal tastes, attributes, moral principles and social ideals. This research drives his artistic practice and materialises mainly in the form of sculptures and installations. Chun received his MFA from the Glasgow School of Art, and is the co-founder of the curatorial collective LATENT SPACES, which reinvents idle spaces in Singapore as platforms for experimental art. In 2015, he was conferred the Young Artist Award, Singapore’s highest recognition for young art practitioners.
In the words of curator Michelle Ho, who penned an accompanying essay for the exhibition, Chun’s works “have been conceived with an awareness of the improbability of their realisations, and a sense of the futility of their endeavours …… what is noteworthy is the artist’s outright disclosure of his failure.” Of the present work, she writes: “The Mistakes I’ve Made While Building The Joe Olympic Swimming School Diorama started as his intent to make a diorama, based on his reflections of the journeys of Olympic champion Joseph Schooling and Paralympian Yip Pin Xiu, and how their stories provided alternative accounts regarding the ease of achieving one’s dreams. In the process of making the work, he noted some less than satisfactory results – defects that occurred - and Chun turned them into the basis of the artwork. The work became an artwork about itself, with the confessions of an artist detailing his imperfect skills. More critically, Chun also deals with the perception of failure, and its relativity …… By embarking on the futile endeavours that he insists on pursuing, and navigating through unfavourable conditions that he has chosen to situate his works within, Chun turns failure into productive engagements …… Such is the nature of Chun’s works which operate in the realm between heroic aspiration and absurdity, using humour and failure to play off the futility of ambition against the ideal of excellence, and through such an artistic determination, bring about new possibilities for expanding the purpose of art.” (Ho, “Flawed Miracles – The Art of Chun Kai Qun”, 2016.) 
What is particularly striking about Mistakes, then, is the salient disjuncture between its ostensible theme, success, and its material being, its status as a failed experiment. Joseph Schooling, of course, stands as the epitome of success, being the first Singaporean to win a gold medal at the summer Olympics; in that regard, he also serves as an encapsulation of the Singapore Story, with its emplotted trajectory of overcoming almost insurmountable hurdles, and moving from a third world outpost to a flourishing first world economy. Joseph Schooling, is success incarnate, the Singapore Story made flesh. Juxtaposed against this shining beacon is the abject condition of the object, an attempt gone awry in the studio: “Chun features small figures who gamely swim or sink within a swimming pool of solidified resin, disingenuously admitting to several minute “errors” (“I glued down number 2 crooked”)—which naturally triggers compulsory inspection of the work.” (from a review of the show on Art Asia Pacific’s online edition, by Marybeth Stock). In purporting to depict a success story, what Chun has done instead is to present a failure as a finished product, to expand the conceptual notions of object-making."

His practice encompasses both the two- and three-dimensional, with the latter most often assuming the form of site-responsive installations, which are critical engagements with the social and political connotations of the site of display, and the relation of the object to the space and architecture. Chong’s preferred mediums in the two-dimensional include painting and drawing, as well as new media formats such as video. 

In the Boundary Fluidity series, Chong has produced a series of maps rendered on large pieces of tarpaulin, with an accompanying video. In a recent solo exhibition at Wei-Ling Gallery in Kuala Lumpur, these maps were hung from the ceiling, consecutively installed in one line, with others lying supine and spread out on the floor, or rolled-up and leaning against the wall. These maps, comprised of crimson, black, white, grey and bluish acrylic encrustations and criss-crossing webs of lines, cracks, tears and cuts, are palimpsestic renderings of historical maps of Malaya and the South China Sea region, from the colonial period and right up to the era of nation-building in the 1950s and ‘60s. Barely glimpsed the thick impasto are place names such as Gemas, Malinan, Malacca or Singapur - the old colonial Malaysia stated additionally in the words “Malaya Britanica”, separated or connected through a number of fine or bold lines. Though globalization suggests a de-territorialised world, borders are omnipresent and a sociological and political fact – controlling the movement and flow of communities and capital across the globe. As Chong himself observes, boundaries are fluid. They keep on transforming endlessly – a characteristic that also marks personal identity. According to Stewart Hall, identities are never completed, and, in fact, they are always in motion. They are the originary point of history; history and its changes are nothing but a mirror of the unstable human identities. From this perspective, the Boundary Fluidity series seems to transform the awareness of frontiers and borders as places of conflict into places of great potential. The many intertwined lines can be read as a grid system, a net holding together all the different spaces, places and identities; they even can suggest the growth of identities like rhizomes, into more complex and layered identities, suggesting pluralism or hybridity as our natural state of being."

In 1956 he began teaching art at Methodist Girls School, Kuala Lumpur, and was transferred to Victoria Institution in 1959 where he taught until 1963. In the 1960s, he underwent formal art training in London, United Kingdom, after being awarded the Sino-British Fellowship Trust to study art in Britain. Between 1964 and 1966, he was enrolled at Hammersmith College of Art. He pursued a major in art and textiles at the Wimbledon and Southlands College of Education from 1966 to 1968. Eventually, he settled down in the England where he passed away in 1989.

Having graduated from the Malaysian Institute of Art (MIA), Liew got his start as an artist with the Ruman Air Panas collective (alongside such figures as Yap Sau Bin, Chong Kim Chiew, Phuan Thai Meng et al). The work produced in the early part of his career were non-figurative canvases in the lineage of mid-century abstraction, and its sub-categories of geometric abstraction, colour field painting, hard-edge painting and minimalism. Beginning in 2011 and 2012, however, Liew’s practice took a radically different tack. At a solo exhibition in 2012 at Valentine Willie Fine Art (where he had previously been employed as an gallery assistant), entitled “????, ????– Painted Words and Written Paintings: For the Refined and For the Masses”, he presented a series of compositions that included a grotesque, surreal iconography drawn from a personal and private visual language, with generous helpings of textual elements based on Chinese characters, sayings and cross-cultural punning. 

The present work, ? Tolong ?,? Tolong ?, was first shown in the VWFA solo exhibition. Being a former employee at the gallery, Liew was exposed to a kaleidoscopic range of artistic styles and a relatively liberal artistic atmosphere, which represented a liberation for him, but also accentuated his discomfort with that particular social milieu, which was English-speaking, westernized and globalized. Hailing from a Chinese-speaking, working-class background, Liew spent 3 years at MIA, specializing in traditional Chinese ink painting and calligraphy – a considerably brief education for an artistic beginner whose childhood and teenage years were defined by cultural signposts such as Japanese manga, Cantonese TVB dramas and popular cinema from Hong Kong, and local vernacular culture. In other words, Liew’s socio-economic class and attendant education marked out his outlook and cultural worldview as an artist, and the shift in his aesthetic language stemmed from a growing desire to reflect that background and the social divide he experienced; the resurgence of figurative forms in his formerly abstract compositions alludes to the tenets of both Marxism and modernism. (At the same time, Malaysian society – including both its middle and working classes – was going through a significant change, due largely to a popular social movement, Bersih, agitating against blatant corruption in the highest levels of the Najib administration.) From an abstract idiom devoid of narrative, Liew tried to develop a visual language that could speak to a local audience unfamiliar with the concerns and aesthetics of contemporary art in a globalized vein. 

Here, Liew also introduced calligraphy into his pictorial compositions, with handwritten Mandarin and Malay words in thick acrylic paints, creating readable logograms enfolded into his visual iconography. Beginning in 2011, the Chinese character ?(person, human) has appeared frequently in Liew’s works; it also figured in into other related words that share the same radical, such as in ?(greed). In ? Tolong ??? Tolong ?, the logogram of ?was embedded in the motif of cash coins; it has been multiplied and painted as the orange eyebrows or the black mustache, personifying both the official (?) and the businessman (?). Other elements issued from different registers of vernacular culture, ranging from amateurish mural painting in Chinese temples to the unrefined visuals of comic books from both Hong Kong and Japan, laid out in symmetric composition that recalls the tao-tie of ancient Chinese bronzes, and orchestrated like a chorus composed of axioms, myths and tricksters, depicting an absurd scene extracted from a national saga. The painting shows us an enclosed man-made system that looks like a pair of contaminated lungs in the process of an alchemic transmutation fueled by a permanent restructuring of power due to the unapologetic practice of *nepotism and *cronyism in the country."

Unusually, this view of the Taj Mahal from across the Yamuna river in the city of Agra was painted over a thousand kilometres away by a Murshidabad artist. The lack of detail on the Taj Mahal buildings and the naturalistic watercolour style suggests the possibility that the artist may not have seen the Taj Mahal and modelled this painting on sketches or paintings by visiting European artists.

The primary motivation of these patrons for collecting such paintings was purportedly documentary hence Company paintings generally depict scenes of daily life, occupations, festivals, architecture, local flora and fauna. This painting belongs to the Patna school, considered to be one of the most prolific centres as Patna rose in prominence and prosperity under British administration, prompting artists to move from Murshidabad. This painting appears to reflect the style of Sewak Ram, one of the more renowned painter who had migrated to Patna from Murshidabad in 1790.There is no evidence however to suggest that Sewak Ram was indeed the artist of this piece.

This vibrant painting offers a glimpse into the myriad rituals that constitute traditional Muslim wedding customs in India. Although only the nikah (solemnisation ceremony) and a feast (walima) are required to conduct a wedding according to Islamic orthodoxy, additional local traditions may be incorporated. The scene most likely corresponds to the sharbat pilai ceremony that takes place immediately after the nikah ceremony, where the bridegroom is taken into the bride’s house among the company of womenfolk from the couple’s families, to drink the sharbat, a sweet syrup."

He attended the Malay School at Sungai Air Tawar (1950-53), and the Government English School in Sabak Bernam (1954-56). He studied at the Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur (1957-61). As an artist, Ismail is primarily self taught. He did, however, received the guidance of his art teacher, Patrick Ng, as a student at the Victoria Institution and a member of the Wednesday Art Group. Before turning twenty-five in 1969, he had been a temporary art teacher at the Government Secondary School in Sabak Bernam (1962), a book illustrator with Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (Language and Literature Agency) (1963-65), and a designer at the Handicraft Development Centre of the MARA Institute of Technology (UiTM) (1966-69). 

He clinched the first prize for his work, ‘Evolution’ (1968), in the batik category at Salon Malaysia in 1968. ‘Evolution’ was selected for Malaysia’s participation at the 10th Sao Paulo Biennial held in 1969. Another three of his batik paintings were also showcased at the Biennial. With a scholarship from UiTM, Ismail studied advertising design at the Art Centre College of Design in Los Angeles, USA between 1969 and 1971, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He worked at Leo Burnett Advertising (1971-81) as its art director. He later joined Johan Design Associates (1981-82) as an associate creative director, and eventually set up his own agency, Ismail & Associates, in 1983 where he served as its managing creative director until 2009. Throughout his practice, the artist has produced works of diverse stylistic expression which may have been influenced by the training he received and his experiences in different artistic fields, namely illustration, textile design and graphic design. 

Through his work, Ismail has contributed to Malaysia’s nation-building projects locally and internationally. For instance, his mural design, which is discussed below, was used for the façade of a government building in the country’s capital. The painting proposed for this acquisition was produced in the 1960s, a critical time for a newly-independent nation during which the government sought ways – in this case, visual and artistic – to project national ideals to a wide audience. ‘Three Horizons’ was part of a travelling exhibition in Europe between 1965 and 1967. Sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, this exhibition showcased a selection of paintings and sculptures by contemporary Malaysian/Singaporean artists such as Latiff Mohidin, Chuah Thean Teng, Cheong Soo Pieng, Chen Wen Hsi, Hoessein Enas, Syed Ahmad Jamal and Khoo Sui Hoe. 

Ismail experienced early success in his late teens. When he was only seventeen years old and a pupil at the Victoria Institution, he was regarded as a prodigy after making an entry into the arena of public art when, in 1961, his first mural design won the grand prize in a nation-wide competition and was chosen to adorn the façade of Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP). His design materialised into a 64 ¼ x 34 ¼ ft (approx. 20 x 10m) mosaic which was celebrated as “the largest in the country” in 1962 (“A Mighty Mural Gets Its Final Touches”, The Straits Times, 31 January 1962, p. 20). 

‘Three Horizons’ is a triptych – of semi-abstract paintings – which depicts a stylized, nude female figure lying on her side, with her head in the right-most panel, her torso in the middle and her lower body in the left-most one. Her long spiny fingers resemble claws, and her hands are tied loosely together with what looks like a red barbed wire. Parts of her stomach and legs appear as though the skin had been cut open, exposing her internal organs and muscles, and suggesting a surrealist touch to the painting. The painting also displays cubist elements as seen with the different angles by which the face and body were rendered. Done in a palette of reds, browns, oranges, yellows and blues, the female figure stands out against a dark, quiet background. A horizon runs across the three panels at the top of the work. A solitary moon is positioned at a distance in the middle panel. Despite standing out against the background, the figure appears to fuse with the background at some parts. The left-most panel, for instance, shows her lower body abstracted to look as though it is part of a mountainous landscape. 

Produced when Ismail was twenty-one years old and prior to the formal art training he underwent in the late 1960s, ‘Three Horizons’ bears a composition and stylistic approach that are arguably influenced by the work he had done for the mural designs in the early 1960s. Here he created an image of a stylized figure that is laid out across three segments of a pictorial space, with each segment focusing on different parts of the female figure."

(The Young Contemporaries award was started by the NVAG in 1974.) He participated twice more, in 2002 and 2004, with … Who Gave Birth to the Great White One … and The Grand Phantom Narrates, respectively. Yap considers these early works a trilogy or series of sorts (post facto). They mark the beginning of his practice as a conceptually-driven artist; the Bakat Muda Sezaman (BSM) series is primarily concerned with the interrogation and deconstruction of social and institutional contexts, esp. those in which hierarchies of power are operative. He was particularly interested in looking critically at exhibitionary and museological contexts, or how such frameworks impart significance and determine meaning with regards to art objects. The Grand Phantom Narrates, the last in this loose trilogy, is more explicitly concerned with political power. The piece is Yap’s response to the momentous resignation of Mahathir as prime minister of Malaysia in 2003. (The latter is, perhaps, the Grand Phantom and narrator of the title, possessing the wherewithal to shape discourse.) The work is an installation, comprised of half a red picture frame hung on one side of a white wall, and, on the other, another half picture frame, this time in white; on the ground, under each half-frame, is a piece of red carpet, also looking like it was cut in half. Viewed from the side, the installation is meant to evoke the sight of a red canvas passing through a white wall, and emerging on the other side of the wall rendered white. The wall, of course, is a metonym for the institution (as it physically was, during the work’s initial display at the NVAG in 2004). The cultural institution is here conflated with political ones, and both stand as symbols of power, and the way that this institutional power – whether cultural, as with the museum, or political, as with the prime ministership – whitewashes and controls individual autonomy and subjectivity."

Featuring intricate embroidery and needlework, Jakkai confronts socio-political issues afflicting Thailand through the medium of fabric. In his numerous exploration of the turbulent Thai political scene, Jakkai hasn’t shied away from vocal critique. Immediately confrontational, Rape and Pillage features 39 white polyester jacket and trouser uniforms worn by the Thai civil service. Each uniform has been embroidered with the portrait of a Thai politician. Hovering off the ground, these uniforms strike the viewer as spectral representations of the politicians. Jakkai’s distrust of the state’s political leaders rings clear – the title of the work makes no attempt at concealing any disdain whatsoever. Yet, the work is also an invitation to viewers to cast their own judgement on these leaders themselves.In a time of political instability, the textile-based practice of Jakkai Siributr stands as a stark contrast to the state of affairs in the country today. The meticulously-crafted and labour-intensive hand-made pieces, all slow, skillful precision and carefully worked stitching, are in their sobriety and virtuosity in absolute opposition to the ethos of Thai public affairs today: fast, thoughtless, and random."

This is a Certificate of Merit presented to Lim Chong Pang by the Mayor of Syonan, Kanichi Naito in 1945. 
Lim Chong Pang (1904 –1956) was the second son of Lim Nee Soon, the “Pineapple King” of Singapore. A prominent businessman, the range of Lim Chong Pang’s businesses included property and estate management, film production and movie theatres. He was also the director of the Overseas Assurance Corporation, a company his father co-founded.   
Like other prominent community leaders, Lim Chong Pang was imprisoned when the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942 and was released on the condition that he will support the Japanese war effort by raising funds. He was made a council member of the Overseas Chinese Association (OCA) of Syonan and was the vice-chairman of the propaganda department. In 15 February 1945, he was one of thirty-eight local residents given a Certificate of Merit at the Dai Toa Gakjio (Greater East Asian Theatre) for their valuable services rendered to the Administration."

Teh (b. 1988) was educated at the School of Art, Design and Media of NTU, and has so far been included in numerous group shows locally, and abroad in Thailand, Taiwan and China; she enjoyed a solo presentation at 2902 Gallery in their former Waterloo space. Her practice is defined by her interest in the impact of human activity and urban expansion on the natural world, especially in Southeast Asia, and often assumes the mediums of photography, sculpture and installation, integrating photographic images in three-dimensional forms. The present work consists of a triptych of raw concrete panels, into which has been set – in shallow trenches cut into the surface of the panels – narrow strips of photographic prints on dibond. The images are of the Green Corridor, an uninterrupted stretch of natural greenery that runs the entire length of Singapore, from the old Tanjong Pagar Rail Station in the south to the border of Malaysia in the north; the stretch, of course, once marked the extent of the Malaysian KTM line that reached its southern terminus in Singapore. The material configurations of the piece are symbolic and immediately recognizable: the concrete suggests the rapid and large-scale urbanization of the island’s terrain, and the strips of images of vegetation evokes the corridor itself, a confined, circumscribed island of natural flora adrift in a sea of unchecked development – at the expense of the environment."

He, like other Philippine artists at that time, were experimenting with semi-abstract forms and Zóbel initially drew particular inspiration from Philippine folk art, even authoring the book Philippine Colonial Sculpture (1958) due to his interests. He, and the circle of artists he found camaraderie with, frequented and exhibited at the Philippine Art Gallery, a small gallery dedicated to modern art which gave young artists an opportunity to exhibit their works. These artists were often viewed in opposition to the conservative group, who made figurative and idealized images after the works of established artist Fernando Amorsolo. Artists like Zóbel felt what was important was the quality of painting, rather than the modern vs conservative debate.  While he was a leading figure in Philippine abstraction, Zóbel also remarked, “The whole abstract versus figurative bores me; I find it beside the point.” 

Zóbel initially struggled with abstraction but found the language he was seeking in his Saeta series. The Saetas, in their inspiration in the numerous scaffoldings Zóbel was exposed to in his family business, also reflect the rapid urbanization and reconstruction of Manila after the devastation of World War II. The architect Leandro Locsin, who Zóbel often worked with and whose modernist structures were congruent with Zóbel’s tastes, recounted that Zóbel had told him, “My God, look at all these scaffoldings, they’re beautiful! There are so many ugly buildings around that many times, the scaffoldings are even more beautiful than the buildings.”

In terms of technique, Zóbel had initially struggled with creating thin, controllable lines with oil paint, eventually arriving at using a glass hypodermic syringe with its needle removed. The solution came to him upon seeing a cook writing “Happy Birthday” in icing on a cake.

“Saeta 44” is a strong example which demonstrates Zóbel’s innovative technique and which also carries the narrative of Philippine postwar modernism, especially in how it was fostered after the war’s destruction and how Zóbel was one of the earliest artists in the Philippines to paint in abstraction. Lines of white and yellow paint splay out in numerous directions, forming several junctures and giving the impression of rapid movement. They particularly stand out over the layers of black and brown underpaint. While it seems like the work was made spontaneously, Zóbel often made several preparatory studies before painting and was a consummate drawer. He had even suggested that, “You might define the Saetas as drawing in thin lines against a field of color.”"

As an artwork, ‘Cadastre’ physically comprises 75 hand-produced, French colonial-era floral-designed lacquer tiles positioned on a raised platform. Contextually, ‘Cadastre’ refers to the collective sub-consciousness of the Vietnamese people, particularly those based in Hanoi, which is rooted in Vietnam’s history. Together, the 75 tiles amount to an area of 3 square meters – the precise area that each person in Hanoi was afforded during the country’s period of land reforms. One was confined to this area to live in, having to incorporate kitchen, toilet, and living area into this restrictive space.

Cadastre’ is a way for the artist to discover, discuss, show, the prevalent attitude towards land and ownership and show the material size and weight and conceptual “value” of land."

A striking difference between Mak and his peers was his early success in London, which led to his decision to remain away from home to live and work in U.K. as a professional artist. 

Born in 1940 when Singapore was still a British colony, Mak grew up amidst the bustling Joo Chiat district, where his parents ran a laundry business that serviced the British, which later changed to an izakaya (Japanese-style pub) during the Japanese Occupation. Being the youngest of nine siblings, Mak first studied in Yangzheng Primary ???? before enrolling to Chinese High School ????. While the former allowed Mak to cultivate grounds in Chinese calligraphy, it was at the latter that his budding art practice and passion shone. His talent was spotted by Tay Ann Long, Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng. Amongst his peers, Mak was known as Cheong’s favourite pupil, as he was given private lessons afterschool at NAFA, and both went to London together in 1961 for their individual pursuit of artistic excellence.

In London, Mak Kum Siew first studied at Central Saint Martin's School of Art (1961-1964), followed by gaining acceptance to the Painting programme at the Royal College of Art (1964-1967) through the open-application channel. Here, he formed a lasting relation with teacher Peter de Francia (1921 – 2012), who became a confidant to Mak. London was also where Mak became acquainted with Fang Shaoling ??? (1914 – 2006). The two was introduced by Cheong Soo Pieng in the early 1960s and quickly formed a relationship akin to familial members. 

Mak exhibited widely in U.K. with solo exhibitions at Arnolfini (1967), RCA London (1969), Commonwealth Institute (1970); and in group exhibitions at Whitechapel (1964), ICA London (1967), Royal Academy of Arts' Summer Show (1968-1981), National Portrait Gallery (2000), to highlight a few. Between 1968 and 1988, Mak took up teaching positions at a number of art colleges and schools in England and Wales as well.

With a firm grounding in art established in Singapore, and a blossoming phase in U.K., Mak reached a critical point at the end of the 1980s. He found himself tired of the seemingly repetitive art making process of his well-received abstraction pieces, and overtly occupied with his responsibilities in the art schools. 

This artwork belongs to the last series of works by Mak that captures his fixation and experimentation with the basic formality of abstract art, deduced to lines and colours. For Mak, as he shared during the interview / studio visit in February 2017, he wanted to see how far or how much he could alter one’s optical perspective on these 2-dimensional paintings by varying their tone, colour, and undulation, through everyday ordinary materials."

Amongst his peers, Mak was known as Cheong’s favourite pupil, as he was given private lessons afterschool at NAFA, and both went to London together in 1961 for their individual pursuit of artistic excellence.

In London, Mak Kum Siew first studied at Central Saint Martin's School of Art (1961-1964), followed by gaining acceptance to the Painting programme at the Royal College of Art (1964-1967) through the open-application channel. Here, he formed a lasting relation with teacher Peter de Francia (1921 – 2012), who became a confidant to Mak. London was also where Mak became acquainted with Fang Shaoling ??? (1914 – 2006). The two was introduced by Cheong Soo Pieng in the early 1960s and quickly formed a relationship akin to familial members. 

Mak exhibited widely in U.K. with solo exhibitions at Arnolfini (1967), RCA London (1969), Commonwealth Institute (1970); and in group exhibitions at Whitechapel (1964), ICA London (1967), Royal Academy of Arts' Summer Show (1968-1981), National Portrait Gallery (2000), to highlight a few. Between 1968 and 1988, Mak took up teaching positions at a number of art colleges and schools in England and Wales as well.

With a firm grounding in art established in Singapore, and a blossoming phase in U.K., Mak reached a critical point at the end of the 1980s. He found himself tired of the seemingly repetitive art making process of his well-received abstraction pieces, and overtly occupied with his responsibilities in the art schools. 

This artwork belongs to the last series of works by Mak that captures his fixation and experimentation with the basic formality of abstract art, deduced to lines and colours. For Mak, as he shared during the interview / studio visit in February 2017, he wanted to see how far or how much he could alter one’s optical perspective on these 2-dimensional paintings by varying their tone, colour, and undulation, through everyday ordinary materials."

These include large-scale public sculptures, which are displayed throughout Singapore, to life-sized and smaller ones. After undergoing his formal training at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) where he built a strong foundation in drawing and painting, Ng went on to study ceramics in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s. Upon graduation, he worked as an industrial pottery designer in Ireland for two years before returning to Singapore in 1966. These various stints equipped him with, not only the creative and conceptual approaches, but also the necessary technical vocabulary to deal with the three-dimensional form and with different materials.

This bronze sculpture belongs to the iconic “Mother and Child” series created by the artist. Ng Eng Teng, whose oeuvre dealt primarily with the figure and the human condition, believed that humanity began with the family where children would learn values through the dynamic relationships with their parents. The artist has articulated the supportive role that a mother plays in her offspring’s life through various compositions, making the mother and child a recurring motif in his body of works. Some sculptures, for instance, poignantly portray the child sitting restfully on the mother’s lap or in her embracing arms. In this particular work, the mother’s large hands protectively press her child close to her side. 

A sculpture that was cast in Taiwan, “Mother and Child” was left behind in the late artist’s studio for several years. It has been temporarily sited at Tampines Central Park and will be moved to National Gallery Singapore where it will be installed on the existing pavement structure in front of the Gallery, becoming part of the its façade that faces the Padang. It is also the last monumental work produced by the artist. Another work, which was produced in 1980 and also entitled “Mother and Child”, is located at Orchard Parade Hotel."

Ranging from the sandy coast of Bai Bien Thuan Hai, to the forested banks of the Perfume River and along the way stopping at burial sites such as the Tomb of Khai Dinh, and a traditional brick factory, ‘The Game’ spans the length and breadth of the city and was described by the brothers as a way “for them to get to know their city better”. As in their earlier videos, ‘The Game’ sees the brothers play the role of protagonists. Activating their proximity as identical twin brothers, they navigated across the land and sea of Hue and found themselves performing the role of mediators between the histories of tension, civil unrest, war, and eventual reunification of their country. In the video, the brothers – doned in military uniforms – incorporate props such as wooden carved guns with roses sticking out of each barrel, colourful netting, and porcelain plates amongst others, in an attempt to reveal the naïve, complex, and often delicate relationship the Vietnamese have with their country and its history."

Today, it lies in a state of suggestive ruin, the Foo family having left most of their belongings behind, including furniture, antiques and personal letters.

Throughout the 28 years away from his homeland, or tanah air, he attempted to come to terms with his identity and to understand what was happening in Indonesia, largely through mass media where the disseminated image occupies a pivotal role. In the words of the artist, “(t)he indexicality of photos - their authoritative testimonies of what-has-happened - and their transparency* proved problematic in my attempt to come to terms with my absence from Indonesia…The country’s archival press photos, specifically those images that perform national identity through the visual documentations of iconic politicians and historical milestones, often led me to imagine that I was (or could be) a part of this shared identity despite my physical disconnection from Tanah Air while at the same time reminding me why I was never part of it…I wanted to address memories where the personal and political intertwined. I want to relook at these familiar yet disembodied images, reconstruct them in a new place of beginnings and infinitely defer their meanings. If optical memory was all that I could ever have of this history then let that be my entry point and process for re-narration.”

In his installation “Lay down your weapon, follow me”, an installation of 28 pecis-- one for each year of the artist’s absence from Indonesia -- occupies centrestage. The peci is a black felt hat popularized by Indonesia’s first President Sukarno as a nationalistic symbol. Boedi modified these hats into pinhole cameras, to produce 28 negative prints of various images of Sukarno delivering speeches at various occasions. The distanciation of the final image from its source through the processes of its reproduction parallels the emotional and cultural detachment experienced keenly by the artist, from the politics and narratives attached to these images. At the same time, Boedi’s processes reveal a poignant attempt to grasp at some understanding of these histories, albeit one filtered through lenses of his own construction.

*Kendall Walton used the term ‘transparent pictures’ to describe the photograph’s make-believe ability, its function as a lens through which the viewer sees something other than the photo itself."

Prior to moving to Singapore, he held several teaching appointments in Malaysia and London. Teh relocated to Singapore in 1974 to teach at the United World College of Southeast Asia (UWC), where he was in-charge of the 3D Art Department. At the school, he actively organised and participated in several editions of the UWC Arts Festival together Teo Eng Seng and Gavin Waddell, from 1975 to 1979. Teh’s works were captured in several surveys of art and contemporary sculpture in Singapore around the 1970s, including ‘Colour’ at the National Museum Art Gallery (NMAG) in 1977,  ‘Contemporary Singapore Sculpture’ at NMAG in 1978, and the annual display of the permanent collection at NMAG from 1976 to 1979. Teh was also invited to lead several sculpture workshops at the NMAG from 1976 to 1979. 

A sculptor by training and temperament, Teh received considerable albeit short-lived acclaim for what he called his “sculptural reliefs”. He sought to expand the possibilities for both sculpture and painting, and created works using stacked, shaped canvases and reliefs, not unlike the artist Anthony Poon, who created his relief paintings around the same time. This work is representative of Teh’s use of the cosmos as a recurrent motif, informed by the artist’s interest in both the science fiction of HG Wells and his observations of technological advancements of the time."

The painting was then kept on display in the lounge of the conference hall.

He graduated from Jinan University and studied under artists Xie Gongzhan, Ye Gongchou, and Huang Binhong there. Thanks to his close friendship with his teacher Huang Binhong, Tan was able to amass a substantial collection of his works and thus naming it “Bai Hong Lou”, indicating it contains over 100 works by Huang Binhong. 

Tan arrived in Singapore in 1949, where he went on to serve as the principal of Tuan Mong High School and Chung Cheng High School. With his interest in Chinese ink paintings and calligraphy, Tan actively promoted the two, in particularly the latter. In memory of his tireless contribution, the Chinese Calligraphy Society of Singapore established the Tan Keng Cheow Calligraphy Fund in 1991 to award distinguished local calligraphers. 

Pomegranate (A Blessing for Many Children) was clearly a gift for the eldest son of a friend who is older than Tan, as we understands from the accompanying inscriptions. While one reading suggests that this friend may be Tan’s elder sister, it is quite common during that time to address someone who is familiar to you as a sibling. Based on the inscription, we know that this friend is named Pei Ying, while her son is named Rui Qing. 

The content of the painting suggests that it was a gift for Rui Qing’s wedding, as the fruit pomegranate is often used in Chinese ink paintings as a blessed symbol of having many children. This reason lies in the homophonic relation between the Chinese character for children or particularly refers to sons and seeds. Pomegranate is a fruit that has numerous seeds, and hence, became an auspicious symbol ‘to bear many children/sons’."

Shown in the inscription, on a day during the start of the winter season in 1964, Jiong Xi brought along some refined objects, most likely antiques or curiosities of some sort, during his meeting with Wu. It was an enjoyable time. 

While it is not known to us who Jiong Xi might be, the choice of material and motif of this painting emblems the precious moment of friendship and in the changing season. The orange colour of the pumpkin and its swaying leaves gives off a translucent gleamy effect on the paper, which carries specks of white, silver, and gold."

Each orchid is constructed using materials common to silk/artificial flower fabrication, with petals mechanised to open and close slowly. As the artist puts it: “The re-creation of these endemic orchids into their synthetic twin allows for these endemic species to exist elsewhere, however unnatural it may be. They will be forced to become un-native; a forced migration, an especially apt metaphor as it relates to the indigenous communities within the region and the fluid presence of regional migrants. As each race grows generation by generation regardless of nationality, one’s own stake on ownership and native rights become blurred, and the idea of belonging to one group or one culture conversely becomes ever more crucial.” The botanical subject matter of Endemic – while demonstrating the artist’s interest in the history of natural science – also suggests broader thematics of colonialism, migration, authenticity, and the native and the indigenous. These concerns provide the critical contexts within which Chong’s intensive research and fieldwork in the area of Mt. Kinabalu’s endemic flora, and the history of Sabah’s indigenous communities which have long lived with these plants, are framed. This trajectory of Chong’s practice is further demonstration of not only a vitally important strand of art-making in the region – one that is engaged with cultural worlds and registers of knowledge removed from the metropolitan centres – but also one that is responsive to critical issues still impacting the cultural lifeworlds of Southeast Asia today."

Il Fait Bleu (Bandung Series) is a suite of works capturing the silhouettes of various buildings and landscapes in Bandung. It continues the series of the same name initiated in La Rochelle, where Akbar delighted in observing and documenting the forms of French classical architecture intermingled with newer, urban forms – a unique sight for the artist, more accustomed to seeing dilapidated or poorly maintained historic buildings in his hometown. With the Bandung series, Akbar comments on how Bandung (dubbed ‘The Paris of Java’) attempts to emulate an European ideal, in its architecture as well as culture, but falls short in several instances. The work captures a sense of the cityscape in Akbar’s hometown, suffused with a sense of homely familiarity as well as nostalgia."

Paintings from Pang possess an almost musical quality – through his brushstrokes and erasure of the paint that has been applied, the colours presented upon his wood, canvas, or aluminum panels reflect the musical qualities of counterpoint and harmony, even as he delves into themes of apocalypse and chaos. 

Type 0 Civilisation is a work inspired from Pang’s travels to Europe where he encountered works of western masters, such as, John Martin, Gerhard Richter, and Peter Paul Rubens.  Especially drawn to apocalyptic scenes, Type 0 Civilisation is Ruben Pang’s re-capturing of Peter Paul Rubens’ iconic work, The Fall of The Damned. Executing the work intuitively, Pang sought to extract the essence of the work from classical painterly principles of light and shadow. Contrasting the deliberate and planned methodologies utilized by Rubens, Type 0 Civilisation, like numerous of Pang’s other works was executed in a style that can be best described as a stream of consciousness. With no pre-determined goal in mind, Pang’s brushstrokes are led by intuition, reflex, and accident. 

The work’s title references the expanded Kardashev scale, a system of measuring a civilization’s technical advancement based on its ability to harness and store energy. The original Kardashev scale ranges Type I, Type II, and Type III, each corresponding to planetary, stellar, and galactic civilisations; the expanded scale’s inclusion of a Type 0 references our planet’s current state of advancement. In this regard, one may perhaps draw a mirroring between the Archangel Michael’s casting of the fallen angels from the heavens and humanity’s current desire for technological advancement – where the unfettered thirst for power are paths leading to potential ruin."

The animal decorations on both the ewer and the salver allude to this Persian reference with the inclusion of mythical beasts such as senmurv, yali and dragons, with other animals such as elephants and hares. These motifs are set against a detailed foliate ground on the ewer. A hamsa, an aquatic bird with symbolic meaning derived from the Hindu tradition, is depicted on the centre of the salverr.
