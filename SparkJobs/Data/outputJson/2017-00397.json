Nonetheless, the artist used intricate filler motifs, such as squares, circles and stars within each main motif to enhance the overall design of the flowers and plant forms.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.
