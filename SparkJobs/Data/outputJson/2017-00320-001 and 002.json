It was produced in Lan Na (northern Thailand), a major bronze-casting centre. Its prominent cranial bump (ushnisha) was originally topped by a flame finial (now missing) similar to those on the two Sukhothai Buddha images on display in this gallery. \r\n\r\nAs with Sukhothai, Lan Na was heavily influenced by Sri Lankan Buddhism. Styles flowed between the various kingdoms, and Buddha images from Lan Na and Sukhothai share many similarities. Influence also moved by less peaceful means: in the 15th century, Sawankhalok captured by Tiloka, the Lan Na king, who then repulsed a number of attempts by Sukhothai to regain the city. \r\n", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Lanna Buddha Head", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "Early 16th century", "subject_terms_1" : "buddhas (people) attributes (symbols)  nirvana  religious art religious visual works religious symbolism", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Northern Thai", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00320-001 and 002", "shape" : "NA", "creation_place_original_location" : "Thailand, Northern  Lanna (Kingdom)", "subject_terms_2" : "Buddha Nirvana  Introspection Religious art", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "lost-wax process casting (process)", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
