(The Young Contemporaries award was started by the NVAG in 1974.) He participated twice more, in 2002 and 2004, with … Who Gave Birth to the Great White One … and The Grand Phantom Narrates, respectively. Yap considers these early works a trilogy or series of sorts (post facto). They mark the beginning of his practice as a conceptually-driven artist; the Bakat Muda Sezaman (BSM) series is primarily concerned with the interrogation and deconstruction of social and institutional contexts, esp. those in which hierarchies of power are operative. He was particularly interested in looking critically at exhibitionary and museological contexts, or how such frameworks impart significance and determine meaning with regards to art objects. The Grand Phantom Narrates, the last in this loose trilogy, is more explicitly concerned with political power. The piece is Yap’s response to the momentous resignation of Mahathir as prime minister of Malaysia in 2003. (The latter is, perhaps, the Grand Phantom and narrator of the title, possessing the wherewithal to shape discourse.) The work is an installation, comprised of half a red picture frame hung on one side of a white wall, and, on the other, another half picture frame, this time in white; on the ground, under each half-frame, is a piece of red carpet, also looking like it was cut in half. Viewed from the side, the installation is meant to evoke the sight of a red canvas passing through a white wall, and emerging on the other side of the wall rendered white. The wall, of course, is a metonym for the institution (as it physically was, during the work’s initial display at the NVAG in 2004). The cultural institution is here conflated with political ones, and both stand as symbols of power, and the way that this institutional power – whether cultural, as with the museum, or political, as with the prime ministership – whitewashes and controls individual autonomy and subjectivity.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "1 of 1", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "The Grand Phantom Narrates", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "2004", "subject_terms_1" : "politics  carpets  picture frames  power", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "NA", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00945-001 TO 006", "shape" : "NA", "creation_place_original_location" : "Malaysia", "subject_terms_2" : "Art, Malaysian  Installations (Art)  Autonomy  Picture frames and framing Carpets  Political power", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "installing", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
