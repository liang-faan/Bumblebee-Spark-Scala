The application of colour appears to be swift, as evidenced by the visible strokes of the brush and its lack of uniformity in direction. Central to the painting is a thin lady with elongated limbs sporting a headdress; the rice stalks found on the ground behind her suggests that she is the goddess of rice, Shridevi (whose lakshana is a rice).
