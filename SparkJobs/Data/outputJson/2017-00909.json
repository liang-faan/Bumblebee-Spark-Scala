It is a journey that ends when the rainwater meet and merge with the sea between Singapore and Malaysia. Unfolding along a loose narrative, various individuals are met along the way, each of them has a singular – though not-always pleasant – encounter with the waters. History and personal memory are summoned too, through a brief voice-over from the last inhabitant of Singapore’s final remaining house by the sea.\r\n\r\nInformed by Lim’s own experience as a former national sailor, the work is shaped by what the artist perceives as a paradoxical relationship that Singaporeans often have towards water and the sea. Growing up in a densely populated and highly urbanised environment, few residents on the island show a natural affinity for the very thing that circumscribes its shores. Nonetheless, water sits high on the national consciousness: regarded as a critical resource to ensure national security and survival, it is vigilantly managed and ordered.
