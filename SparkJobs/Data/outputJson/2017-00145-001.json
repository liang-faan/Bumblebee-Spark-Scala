The collection consists of original materials belonging to Tan and other members of Force 136 dating from the 1940s to new materials reproduced from memory by Tan Chong Tee, which date from the late 1980s to early 2000s. \r\n\r\nForce 136 was set up in July 1942 as part of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE).
