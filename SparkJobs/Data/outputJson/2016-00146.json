In similar fashion, highly naturalistic terracotta\/clay figures of Indian tradesmen were produced in regions such as Kondapalli in Andhra Pradesh and more importantly in the Bengal region. Krishnagar, Hatwa, Datan, Muzzafarpur, Dacca, Burdwan, Lucknow and Patna (the latter two later on in time than the preceding) such life-like figures, predating photography, were produced. This rare set was produced in Chettinad, Tamil Nadu. \r\nThis musical troupe accompanied by a single female dancer of painted carved wood is a highly decorative, superior example of south Indian dolls made in the 19th century. Every fold of cloth and each body movement and contour has been carefully captured by the wood carver. The faces of each performer are particularly sensitively rendered. The dancer has a metal girdle about her waist from which metal spheres are suspended but other than that, the set is entirely composed of painted and gilded wood. Each member of the set is also taller than is usual. The set has no religious function; it was made purely for decorative reasons for a local client. Other than the female dancer, the set comprises a bag pipe player, a drummer, a cymbals player and five other players of wind instruments. The troupe might well have been for a wedding or some other festivity. Certainly, the troupe with its (part) Western forms of dress such as breeches, stockings, and military jackets and Westernised musical instruments personify musicians who would have performed for wealthy, educated clients.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Nine Polychrome Wooden Sculptures of a Musical & Dance Troupe", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1870 - 1899", "subject_terms_1" : "carvings (visual works) ensembles (musical groups) dolls dancers personification instrumentalists performing artists", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "British Colonial Indian", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00146", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "India, South Cet?t?ina?t?u (India)", "subject_terms_2" : "Wood-carved figurines Dolls Musical groups Dancers Personification in art Instrumentalists Entertainers Wood sculpture", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "woodcarving forming (physical activity) painting (image-making)", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
