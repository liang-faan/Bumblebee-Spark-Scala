The blouse has a scoop neckline, three-quarter length sleeves and a front zip opening.  A colourful border resembling the sawtooth motif runs throughout the edges of the blouse and the pleated centre panel of the skirt.  This uniform was designed by renowned French couturier Pierre Balmain, and was first unveiled in 1968 when Singapore Airlines was still part of Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (MSA).  Balmain’s choice of batik print for the uniforms of both cabin crew and ground staff was a means for SIA to assert Malayan identity and hospitality.  Although the batik print design has been updated over the years, the use of batik and the colours blue, red, brown, brown and green for the batik motif persists.  Today, this uniform is seen in four colours, with each colour denoting the rank of the flight stewardess.\r\n", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "Balmain, Pierre, 1914-1982", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "SIA sarong kebaya uniform", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1970s", "subject_terms_1" : "batik  corporate image identity  flower (motifs)", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "fashion designers", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "NA", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00011-001 and 002", "shape" : "NA", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore  Malaysia", "subject_terms_2" : "Pierre Balmain (Firm)  Corporate image Identity  Floral decorations  Uniforms  Malaysia-Singapore Airlines  Batik  Singapore Airlines", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "sewing (needleworking technique)", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
