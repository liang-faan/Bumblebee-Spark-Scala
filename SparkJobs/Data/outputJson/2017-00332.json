The Chinese influence is evident on this piece, particularly the mythical qilin and phoenix motifs, and fretwork border which is a variant of the auspicious Chinese banji pattern.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Soen King (1861-1942), the first in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her batiks feature the classic layout typical of her time, and are embellished with Chinese traditional motifs.  These motifs include lotus flowers, centipedes and cloud motifs which are rendered sensitively and imaginatively.  The combination of natural red and blue dyes on a cream ground is also characteristic of batiks made during this period in the north coast of Java, before the invention and widespread popularity of chemical dyes in batik sarongs by the late 19th century.
