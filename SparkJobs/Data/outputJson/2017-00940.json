Local artists realised that patronage was shifting from the old Indian aristocracy to the new European traders and military officers in the suburbs and began to adapt to their new patrons’ tastes.\r\n\r\nThe main body of Company painting in Eastern and Upper India developed in the late 18th century in Murshidabad, West Bengal where contact with the Europeans were particularly strong as the Portuguese, British, Dutch and French EICs all maintained factories at Cossimbazar, an important trading centre. This painting was most likely commissioned by a British patron as evident by the factory’s architecture and the depiction of the Union Jack flag proudly flown in front of the building.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "Francesca Galloway (Gallery)  London (England)", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "The Allure of India: Company School Painting from Murshidabad & Patna 1795-1830 exhibition For more see: \r\nFrancesca Galloway.
