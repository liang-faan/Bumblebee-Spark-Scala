It is blue, with lighter blue and white designs. The kain panjang features large bouquets interspersed with birds and butterflies. On the left side of the batik, the bouquet motifs are set against a dense patterned background, with repeated floral blooms. The right side of the batik features a more sparse design, with the bouquets set against a plain blue background.", "context_22" : "NA", "context_14" : "NA", "context_11" : "NA", "sgcool_label_text" : "This batik is structured in the pagi-sore format, comprising two different but related designs on each half of the kain panjang.  One side comprises large bouquets of carnations interspersed with butterflies and birds.  This buketan design is also applied to the other side although the large rose bouquets are surrounded by densely packed background patterns.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Kok Sing (1896-1966), the second in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  Her later batik designs attest to her virtuosity in technique and inventive colour palette.  Her repertoire of tiny isen-isen motifs (filler motifs within the outlines of the key motifs) in particular, exudes a strong sense of artistic individuality, possibly informed by modernist designs on European printed cloths.  Her treatment of floral bouquets is also charactertistic of the undulating and curving lines of the Art Noveau style that was introduced in the northern coast of Java by the Europeans.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Kain panjang", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1941", "subject_terms_1" : "Peranakan flower (motif) birds (motifs) cultural diffusion", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "textile designers", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Peranakan", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00359", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Pekalongan (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Batik Ethnic costume Peranakan (Asian people) Motifs Culture diffusion", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "batik", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
