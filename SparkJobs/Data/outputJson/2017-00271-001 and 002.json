The refined decoration executed in underglaze cobalt blue and the small size of the box suggest that it may have been used to contain seal paste. While seal-paste boxes are not identified as one of the ‘Four Treasures’ of a scholar’s studio, they were an important part of a gentleman’s writing desk as they stored the red paste with which he affixed his seal on a painting or calligraphy. Conversely, such small porcelain boxes may have been used by women for keeping ointments and cosmetics. These boxes were apparently popular overseas as well, as over a thousand small, circular porcelain boxes were found in the Hatcher shipwreck, an Asian ship that sank in the South China Sea around 1643.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Blue and white box with floral decoration", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "17th century", "subject_terms_1" : "floral patterns porcelain paintings (visual works)  symbolism  freehand drawings (drawings)  Wen ren  scholars", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Chinese ceramics styles  Ming (culture, period, and styles)  Chinese export (ceramics style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00271-001 and 002", "shape" : "concave", "creation_place_original_location" : "Jingdezhen (China)", "subject_terms_2" : "Porcelain, Chinese Ming- Qing dynasties, 1368-1912 Blue and white ware China China painting  Floral decorations", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "glazing (coating process)  throwing (pottery techniques)  underglazing molding (forming)  firing (technique)  porcelain painting (image-making) freehand drawing (technique)", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
