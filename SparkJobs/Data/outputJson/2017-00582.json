It has three drawn-thread patterns around the border, consisting of both geometrice patterns and animals. Judging by the hole in the centre, this cloth was possibly used as a handkerchief pinched between the fingers, or with a bunch of keys tied to the centre. This piece is particularly rare due to the embroidery technique - the drawn-thread pattern is usually only done once around the border. Thread-drawn embroidery is not unique to Peranakan culture, and was practiced by other ethnic groups in Java and Sumatra in the early 20th century. However, the combination of the embroidery and Chinese motifs make it highly likely that this piece is from the Chinese-Peranakan community.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Handkerchief", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "early 20th century", "subject_terms_1" : "geometric motifs  scrolling foliage  birds (motifs)  batik art  Peranakan", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Indonesian (culture of style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00582", "shape" : "Square", "creation_place_original_location" : "Padang (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Geometry in art Foliation (Architecture and design)  Birds in art Batik Indonesia  Peranakan (Asian people)", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "batik  drawn thread work", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
