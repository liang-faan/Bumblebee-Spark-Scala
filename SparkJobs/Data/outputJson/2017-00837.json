This series is a contemporary take on traditional Peranakan porcelain or nyonyaware.  Hans Tan was inspired by batik, particularly the resist-dyeing technique, to transform the surface of these wares.  Original glazed portions are preserved in the form of a new dotted pattern while the white porcelain body is revealed after sandblasting away and erasing the original glaze on these pieces.  The combination of green and pink polychrome colours or dots on the original decoration of these pieces are typical of nyonyaware.
