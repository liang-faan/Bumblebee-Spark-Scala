Both Raffles and Sultan Hussein played pivotal roles in the signing of two treaties that resulted in the founding of modern Singapore, and this artwork seeks to uncover the relationships between them. The way these men are represented symbolises the partisanship of various narratives about them in historical discourse, reiterating the sentiment that history is often written by the dominant – in this case, the British – the very writing of which occludes other accounts and perspectives.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "The Most Mild Mannered Men", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "2016", "subject_terms_1" : "busts (figures) allegory (artistic device) historical figures founders (originators)", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "artists (visual artists)", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "NA", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-00573", "shape" : "irregular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore", "subject_terms_2" : "Installations (Art) Busts Allegory (Art) Raffles, Thomas Stamford, Sir, 1781-1826", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "sculpting installing", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
