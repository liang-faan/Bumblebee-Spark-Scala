The model is probably inspired by Dutch pewter examples of tea jars. Similar shaped tea jars are also commonly produced in blue and white porcelain during the 18th century. The warm brown tone is the result of the low sand content of the clay, which comes from Yixing in Jiangsu province, eastern China. \r\n\r\nThe Yixing kilns are known to have produced high quality ceramics, particularly teapots, from as early as the 16th century.
