One witnesses, in the far distance beyond a deserted vestibule, the movement of a human silhouette; little happens on the lawn outside a partially open window, except when a small herd of farm animals darts by; the sound of a whistling voice is heard echoing through the empty hallways of an derelict structure. These forlorn fragments document the interior and surroundings of the titular mansion, located in Ipoh. Falim House was built by Foo Nyit Tse, one of the wealthiest tin tycoons in Malaya in the early twentieth century. Today, it lies in a state of suggestive ruin, the Foo family having left most of their belongings behind, including furniture, antiques and personal letters.
