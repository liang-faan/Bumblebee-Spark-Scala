Richelieu, a Danish naval officer, rose to the rank of vice admiral of the Thai Navy. \r\n\r\nThis type of robe was originally based on Persian or Moghul forms. By the 19th century, these types of robes had begun to incorporate design techniques of a European nature. The gold metallic embellishments probably come from France, with the decoration being similar to that of royal and military garments. This particular robe also has its own idiosyncratic hybrid aspects: its decoration includes images of anchors, whales, and shipâ€™s wheels integrated into the floral patterns.\r\n", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "Thailand", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "Bestowing of title and rank of The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao by King Rama V to Danish Admiral Andreas du Plessis de Richelieu.", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "1902", "title_text" : "Ceremonial Robe", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1902", "subject_terms_1" : "insignias (devices)  cultural diffusion Flower (motif)  diplomacy", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "1902", "context_8" : "kings (people)", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Thai (culture or style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2017-01023", "shape" : "T-shaped", "creation_place_original_location" : "Thailand", "subject_terms_2" : "Regalia (Insignia) Robes  Ceremonial objects  Richelieu, Andreas du Plessis de, 1852-1932 Culture diffusion Flowers in art  Embroidery  Diplomacy", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "1902", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "embroidering", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "Chulalongkorn, King of Siam, 1853-1910", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
