Each panel comprises either an auspicious dragon or phoenix motif.  Framed by brightly coloured floral borders, the dragon and phoenix are worked in gold thread couchings.  The front-facing coiled dragon motif was possibly inspired by Ming dynasty imperial court robes, with the dragon symbolising the emperorâ€™s centrality in the universe.  Dragons are seldom seen in Peranakan embroidery, whereas the phoenix, signifying loyalty and good fortune, is more common.  Here, the dragon represents the yang or male principle while the phoenix represents the complementary yin or female principle.
