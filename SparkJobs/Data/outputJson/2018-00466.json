During this time, he travelled extensively in Europe before returning to Penang to settle in 1969.\r\n\r\nTan is noted as being influenced by fellow Penang-based artist Kuo Ju Ping (1908-1966), who had graduated from NAFA earlier in 1940, as well as other masters of his favoured medium of watercolour, such as Yong Mun Sen (1896-1962) and Abdullah Ariff (1904-1962).\r\n\r\nAs a key second generation artist working primarily in the medium of watercolour, Tan is known for his deft application of ink and colour on paper.
