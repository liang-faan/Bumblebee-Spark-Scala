Born in Haicheng county in Fujian province, settled in Singapore when he was eight and held the title of Ju Ren as he passed the Imperial examinations at the provincial level. He was also the founder of the first progressive Chinese newspaper in Singapore (Thien Nan Shin Po) and championed the cause of women’s education. He donated $3,000 towards the fund of setting up Singapore Chinese Girls’ School in 1899. He was also a fervent supporter of the Reformist Movement in China and invited key reformist Kang Yu Wei to take refuge in Singapore, paying for all his expenses. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Khoo was not adept at managing his fortune and he was declared a bankrupt at age 34. He then earned a living working as an editor for various newspapers such as Cheng Nam Jit Poh, Nan Feng Ri Bao, Jue Hua Zhou Bao and Sin Chew Jit Poh. He was also the chief editor of Sin Chew Jit Poh’s literary supplement, Fan Xin. \r\n\r\nKhoo passed away on 1 December 1941 and was buried at Bukit Brown Cemetary. \r\n", "preference" : "main alternate", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "36C Lor Halwa, Singapore 298637", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Tomb stones of Mr. Khoo Seok Wan ???????", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1930-1940", "subject_terms_1" : "epitaphs  burials  exhumation", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "Bukit Brown Cemetery  citation: \r\n\r\nSingapore Infopedia.
