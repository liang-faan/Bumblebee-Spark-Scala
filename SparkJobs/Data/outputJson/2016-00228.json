The lintel of the doorway bears a carving of the St Thomas Cross or Mar Thoma Sliba, which is an important symbol of the faith for Syrian Christians. \r\nThe Syrian Christian community is culturally Malayalee and follow many of the same traditions regarding clothing, food and architecture. The doorway is typical of domestic architecture from the region. Two high steps which would have led up from the entrance platform are part of the door, and an intact manichithrathazhu or ornate Kerala-style lock made of brass adorns the front of the door. \r\nThe low height of the doors would have necessitated a bending, or bowing down before entering the household.
