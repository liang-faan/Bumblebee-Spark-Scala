Tan is arguably the most important photographer in the region developing colour derivative and photo montage techniques. His works in the 1960s were a result of various experiments meticulously combining multiple colour transparencies into one to achieve the desired montage within one frame.\r\n\r\nTan spent 42 years as a medical photographer at the National University of Singapore. Many of his works have won numerous awards internationally and show a strong graphic and stylistic sensibility. Tan is also the first Singaporean to be awarded a fellowship by the Royal Photographic Society of the United Kingdom in 1970. Conferred the Cultural Medallion in 1985, Tan recently published a retrospective of his works, ‘Light & Shadow: Tan Lip Seng’s 50 Years of Photography’ in 2009.", "preference" : "main alternate", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "Tan, Lip Seng, 1942- Tan, Lip Seng", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "1 of 3", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Two Workers: Original Artwork Two Workers", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1968", "subject_terms_1" : "workers", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "photographers", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Not indicated", "accession_no_csv" : "2018-00048-001", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore (nation)", "subject_terms_2" : "Digitally printed materials Colour prints Employees", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "photographic processes montage (image-making technique)", "scale_type" : "Not indicated", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
