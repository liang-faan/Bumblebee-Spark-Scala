At the same time, this particular painting acts as a record of a visit Wu had. Shown in the inscription, on a day during the start of the winter season in 1964, Jiong Xi brought along some refined objects, most likely antiques or curiosities of some sort, during his meeting with Wu. It was an enjoyable time. \r\n\r\nWhile it is not known to us who Jiong Xi might be, the choice of material and motif of this painting emblems the precious moment of friendship and in the changing season.
