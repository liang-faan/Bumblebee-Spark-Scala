The main body of the kain panjang features zigzag bands of mythical animals and birds. Filler motifs are also used to decorate each band and segment, creating an intricate and dense design.

A variety of filler motifs are used in each decorative band.  On the broad vertical panel (kepala) of this cloth, interlocking triangles (or tumpal) sandwich a row of upright diamonds.  Like the zigzag bands, they are filled with curious animals and plant forms.  This batik comes from the family collection of Oey Djien Nio (1929-1987), the last in three generations of documented batik-makers in Pekalongan.  In her earlier signatures, she used her husband’s name, Liem Siok Hien.  But from 1965 onwards, she used Jane Hendromartono, combining her husband’s new Indonesian family name, Hendromartono with Jane, as people addressed her by.  She developed a personal style distinct from her mother and grandmother, and experimented with a wide spectrum of colours and exotic combinations of birds, rock formations and mythical animals.  Jane Hendromartono’s clientele expanded beyond the elite in Indonesia to include Europe, America and Japan, especially in the 1980s.
