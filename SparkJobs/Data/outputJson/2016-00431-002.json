It was later revealed that Huang Wei never existed – at least not in real life – but was a fiction created by artist-curator Alan Oei. Oei has an enduring fixation with history painting but is troubled that it possesses pale relevance to art-making in the present day. In Huang Wei, Oei entwined fiction with fact and created a character who stands as a metaphor for a vital but missing part of Singapore’s art history. In effect, Huang Wei may be regarded as a performance on several levels, and the relationship between creator and created echoes that of a two-way mirror. On one side, the character of Huang Wei is a conduit and device for Oei to unravel his conundrum about time and history. Yet to ‘use’ Huang Wei entails Oei becoming a medium himself and ‘channelling’ his creation so that the meta-artist can step through time’s portals and enter a realm where history painting still reigns. Still, even liminal spaces offer fleeting refuge and the stop-motion video Goliath unfolds to reveal the artist’s hand (Huang Wei, and\/or Oei?) in a continuous cycle of creating-destroying his painting, time and again. Alan Oei (b. 1976, Singapore) is an artist-curator interested in the workings between art history, politics and community. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Art History from Columbia University and a Diploma in Fine Arts from Lasalle College of the Arts. Huang Wei – a fictional post-war painter of maimed children – is the alter-ego Oei uses to present his paintings. His work has been shown in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Melbourne and New York. In addition, Oei’s curatorial projects include the ‘OH! Open House’, an annual art walkabout inside local neighbourhoods and residences. He was recently appointed the Artistic Director of Substation, Singapore.", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "Oei, Alan, 1976-", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "English", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "The End of History - Black Painting #1", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "2008-2013", "subject_terms_1" : "aliases portraits destroyed works", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "painters (artists)", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "NA", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00431-002", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Singapore", "subject_terms_2" : "Portraits Painting", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "painting (image-making)", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
