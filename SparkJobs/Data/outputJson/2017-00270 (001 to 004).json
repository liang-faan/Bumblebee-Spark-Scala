Covered ceramic boxes from China have been found in large quantities in Southeast Asia, and were most probably used to store incense, cosmetics or medicines. \r\nAlthough the decorative style of arranging designs into panels is generally associated with Kraak porcelain produced at Jingdezhen, it was also adopted by the Fujian potters at Zhangzhou. The relatively thick bodies, off-white glaze colour and more spontaneously-rendered decoration, suggests that the boxes were probably made at the Zhangzhou kilns. Boxes are unusual among extant examples of Zhangzhou wares, making this pair an important addition to the museumâ€™s collection of Zhangzhou ceramics. \r\n", "preference" : "main", "context_6" : "National Museum of Singapore", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "The dish was exhibited in the Exhibition of Chinese Blue-and-White Ceramics exhibition held at the National Museum of Singapore in April 1978.
