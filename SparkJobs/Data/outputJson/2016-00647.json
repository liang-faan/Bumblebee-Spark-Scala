This deity is adapted from Fujianese or Cantonese Buddhist folklore, and is shown seated playing the pipa, a Chinese string instrument.  Surrounding her are Chinese auspicious symbols, aquatic animals and dancing celestial beings rendered in European style.  The two panels are bordered by fretwork, possibly a variant of the banji pattern, believed by the Chinese to contain talismanic properties.  This tok wi was likely produced in Cirebon, a northern Javanese coastal town comprising a large population of Chinese.  The ‘cloud’ motif (megamendung) in particular, is commonly associated with Cirebon.  It is derived from the Chinese auspicious ruyi cloud motif.  These cloths decorated the front of altar tables in homes and in some temples.  Instead of coloured silks or gold thread couchwork in imported Chinese examples, batik altar cloths were more common in Java.", "preference" : "alternate main", "context_6" : "NA", "creator_1" : "NA", "context_1" : "NA", "edition_description" : "NA", "title_language" : "", "context_19" : "NA", "context_21" : "NA", "context_15" : "NA", "context_5" : "NA", "title_text" : "Altar cloth: Dewi Cina Bian Cai Tian goddess Altar cloth with Dewi Cina Bian Cai Tian goddess motif", "inscription_language" : "", "creation_date" : "1900-1920", "subject_terms_1" : "deities Peranakan cultural diffusion Cantonese motifs", "context_16" : "NA", "context_10" : "NA", "context_4" : "NA", "context_8" : "NA", "creator_role" : "NA", "context_20" : "NA", "styles_periods_indexing_terms" : "Indonesian (culture or style)", "accession_no_csv" : "2016-00647", "shape" : "rectangular", "creation_place_original_location" : "Cirebon (Indonesia)", "subject_terms_2" : "Altar-cloths Gods Peranakan (Asian people) Culture diffusion Batik Motifs", "Image" : "", "context_3" : "NA", "context_9" : "NA", "techniques_name" : "batik sewing (needleworking technique)", "scale_type" : "NA", "context_13" : "NA", "context_7" : "NA", "context_12" : "NA", "context_17" : "NA"}
